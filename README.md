# The UK Intelligence Community Design System (ICDS)

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/tree/main/LICENSE)

The [Intelligence Community Design System](https://design.sis.gov.uk) helps the United Kingdom's Intelligence Community (MI6, GCHQ, MI5, and partners) to quickly build powerful capabilities that are accessible and easy to use.

This is a joint project led by [MI6](https://www.sis.gov.uk), working with [GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk) and [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk).

This repo holds the website at [`design.sis.gov.uk`](https://design.sis.gov.uk), look at the [`ic-ui-kit` repo](https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit) for the ICDS UI Kit components.

## Why we're doing this

We build a lot of stuff that needs to be quick-to-build, usable and always accessible. We build using a lot of different tech, so creating something that can be consistently accessible and usable across different stacks is critical for us.

The Design System is being used to build our powerful, flexible and complex capabilities that help keep the UK safe and prosperous.

üìñ [Read our story](https://design.sis.gov.uk/get-started/a-design-system) to learn more on why we've created our own design system.

### Learning from the best

We track many sources of accessibility expertise, as well as using our internal experts and communities. For example, many of our patterns and components are based on awesome work from the [Government Digital Service (GDS) Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). Where we can, we'll contribute back!

If you think we could improve something, please do [raise an issue](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/issues/new/choose).

## Installing

The UI Kit components are in the [`ic-ui-kit` repo](https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit) üëâ.

If you still want to host a local version of the `ic-design-system` website, it's straightforward.

```
// dev mode
npm i
npm run start

// production build outputs to ./dist
npm run clean
npm run build
```

We use GitHub Actions and Pages to host the website, which is automatically published from `main` branch ‚òÅÔ∏è.

## Contributing

We have a couple of resources to help you with contributing.

- To find out more about the different types of contributions, the criteria, raising issues or our roadmap read [how to contribute to the Design System and UI Kit](https://design.sis.gov.uk/community/contribute).
