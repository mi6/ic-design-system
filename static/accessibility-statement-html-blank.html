            We want as many people as possible to be able to use this app. That

            The app hosts documents that describe Policy, Process and Procedure
            for the organisations. The accessibility regulations apply to
            content hosted within the app even if it is authored from another
            tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the policy documents hosted on Portal are core to the
            Services it provides, these documents must be accessible. The
            regulations require that this applies to documents published before
            23rd September 2018 because they are core to the Services of the
            app.

            ‘Guidance’ attachments created before 23rd September 2018 are
            therefore exempt and are not assured to be accessible at this time.
            We commit to flagging non-accessible attachments clearly in the app.
            We commit to requiring content contributors to improve the
            accessibility of their content, or risk it being removed.

              Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now
              will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the

          <h4>Interactive tools</h4>

          <p>
            Some of the interactive flowchart and form creation tools are
            difficult to navigate using a keyboard and screen reader. For
            example, because the workflow builder relies on visuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flowchart builder and form builder are built using third party
            software and 'skinned' to look like our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've assessed the [effort/time] cost of fixing the issues these
            tools. We believe that doing so at the current time would be a
            <a

            >
            within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. Currently we
            are piloting the app with a user group of less than 25 users. This
            will be re-assessed frequently as the app is rolled out and the user
            base grows.
          </p>
          <p>
            This workflow/form functionality is not ‘core’ to the app. This
            functionality is limited to a group of users who need to – and have
            been trained on – building workflows and forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the app is published we commit to ensuring the issues are
            fixed or that there is an equitable alternative for users to
            requiring this functionality.
