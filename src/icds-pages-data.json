They are often used for interactive images.\n\nFavour SVG over `<canvas>` because the `<canvas>` element is not accessible to assistive technologies.

It only changes the information used by assistive technologies.\n\n### The first rule or ARIA\n\nThe first rule of [using ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/) is to favour using native HTML instead of re-purposing an element by adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible.\n\nBy using the semantic HTML you not only get an implicit ARIA role, so the browser knows how to interpret the element, but also other standard functionality such as focus, keyboard and mouse support.\n\n### Time to use ARIA\n\nThe main situation where ARIA can improve the usability even when semantic HTML has been used is with [live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).\n\nLive regions mean that any dynamic changes within it will be read out to assistive technologies, useful to identify errors or of a status change, for example.\n\nTo make an element a live region, use the `aria-live` attribute or a specialised live region `role` such as `role=”alert”`.\n\nIf you do have to add ARIA to unsemantic HTML, remember it’s not just about applying the right `role`, you also need to ensure all the other standard functionality is also applied including focus, keyboard and mouse support.\n\n### Learn more about ARIA\n\nTo learn more about ARIA:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Deque has an easily digestible 3 part blog post for the{\" \"}\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.deque.com/?s=ARIA%20Spec%20for%20the%20Uninitiated&post_type=post\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      ARIA spec for the uninitiated\n    </ic-link>\n    .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Mozilla also covers{\" \"}\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      ARIA\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    extensively with tutorials and a range of documentation.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Google's Web Fundamentals gives a thorough{\" \"}\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      introduction to ARIA\n    </ic-link>\n    .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    W3’s{\" \"}\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      using ARIA\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    gives more guidance on how to use ARIA properly including the all five rules\n    of ARIA.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## When it goes wrong\n\nUnderstanding when and how to use ARIA is key to improving the experience of assistive technology users.

Some apps and services may auto-generate a summary description of data. You can hide this using CSS if you don't want it visible to sighted users.\n\nThe HTML example for a table with header cells in the top row and first column:\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <caption>\n    Example table with four columns and three rows\n  </caption>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Table</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Column Header A</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Column Header B</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Column Header C</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 1</th>\n    <td>data cell A1</td>\n    <td>data cell A2</td>\n    <td>data cell A3</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 2</th>\n    <td>data cell B1</td>\n    <td>data cell B2</td>\n    <td>data cell B3</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\n### Example\n\n<table>\n  <caption>Example table with four columns and three rows</caption>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Table</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Column Header A</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Column Header B</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Column Header C</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 1</th>\n    <td>data cell A1</td>\n    <td>data cell A2</td>\n    <td>data cell A3</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 2</th>\n    <td>data cell B1</td>\n    <td>data cell B2</td>\n    <td>data cell B3</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n## When it goes wrong\n\nIf no table HTML elements were used, then there would be no structure or definition of the table available to assistive technologies.\n\nEven missing table headers in a `<table>` means assistive technologies can't associate data cells with the headers. Visual cues aren't enough to make a table inclusive.\n\nHistorically, tables were incorrectly used for layouts, which would give assistive technology users a confusing experience. Don't use tables for any layout needs.\n\nMany screen readers will summarise the size of the table when it arrives at one, so our table example would say “Table with 4 columns and 3 rows”.\n",

Good (and accessible) design considers implications of the full spectrum of diversity.\n\n## Accessible is better for everyone\n\nAccessible apps are always more usable for people who don't have accessibility needs. If you become skilled at considering accessibility, you'll always end up with a better product.\n\nSomething can be accessible to some people while being inaccessible to others. An app with a real-time data table might work really well for sighted users and those who use a screen reader.\n\nHowever, if someone has a different reading comprehension or has anxiety from information overload, they may experience significant issues if table rows are rapidly changing or flashing.\n",

It's important not to disregard accessibility because you 'can't find anyone with accessibility needs'.\n\nOnly test your apps with real users [when you've completed your own accessibility testing](/accessibility/testing#testing-with-real-people). This means you don't waste people's time, and you can get more valuable usability insights.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nDisclosing a disability or impairment is an individual decision, and there is no obligation for anybody to do so. The point at which an individual discloses a disability or impairment (if at all) varies from case to case.\n\nThere are many reasons why someone may or may not choose to disclose. Reasons for non-disclosure include a fear that it will disadvantage them if disclosed. Some may have a disability or impairment they have not yet discovered and so wouldn't know there was a need for disclosure.\n\nThere are also many reasons why disclosing a disability is a positive action that will empower, protect and assist someone in the workplace.\n\nAwareness of someone's needs may mean that provision can be made for reasonable adjustments. The person and their colleagues may feel more comfortable to have open conversations about their requirements. This can lead to the person facing fewer barriers to employment and training opportunities.\n\nDiscussing someone's needs should be handled sensitively and on a one-to-one basis.\n",

[Templates are available](/accessibility/documenting/accessibility-statements#the-template).\n\nThe numbered headings correspond to the sections you will find within the Accessibility Statement.\n\n<p>\n  It's based on the{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    sample accessibility statement\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  published by the Government Digital Service (GDS).\n</p>\n\nMost of it is legally required and needs to be published to comply with the organisation's accessibility requirements. Don't change the order of sections or wording unless this guidance tells you to.\n\nDon't use the statement to justify why an app is inaccessible, other than in the \"Disproportionate Burden\" section.\n\nYou can also [download this guidance (DOCX)](/accessibility-statement-guidance.docx).\n\n### Where to publish\n\nThe [when to create and update](/accessibility/documenting/when-to-create-and-update) page explains where to publish the completed Accessibility Statement.\n\n### How to use the template\n\nYou may need to make minor changes, such as changing between singular and plural or 'app to service', but don't re-order, change titles or remove anything unless this guidance tells you to.\n\nKeep the language simple. This statement needs to be understandable for everyone in the department, it shouldn't be technical.\n\nUpdate everything in square brackets (between '[' and ']') &ndash; remove the square brackets.\n\nIt has examples and sample wording and guidance. Remove anything marked as 'EXAMPLE'.\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis section is used to highlight how accessible the app is. The sample bullet points aren't a checklist but will be true when the app is compliant to EN 301 549 or the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level A and AA criteria.\n\nIf the app doesn't have user guides, remove that statement.\n\nKeep this section up to date if part or most of the app doesn't comply and the statements in the bullet points aren't true.\n\nIf the app is fully or partly made up of third-party software, note this here. Reference the conformance level that the vendor provides. If the vendor doesn't provide accessibility documentation, request it from them.\n\n## 2. How accessible this app is\n\n<IcAlert\n  message=\"Delete the examples in the template before publishing\"\n  variant=\"info\"\n/>\n\nThis section is used to summarise any accessibility problems in the app. Document workarounds to inaccessible content or features.\nConsider a user of the app and think about what issues they would want to know about.\n\nProvide full detail of the accessibility problem later under 'non-accessible content'.\n\nIf the app is compliant and there's no accessibility problems, include the sentence:\n_“We're confident that this app is accessible.”_\n\n## 3. What to do if you can't access parts of this app\n\nThis section is used to explain alternatives and workarounds for accessibility problems that you are aware of.\n\nIt's not possible to predict all possible needs someone might have when using your app. The app must have a process to deal with these requests even if the app is compliant to the relevant standard.\n\n**Don't** use this section to justify why something is not accessible.\n\nIf the app is corporately supported, it's likely that accessibility adjustments would be requested through a Service Desk. If the app is not corporately supported, the development team must be able to deal with these requests.\n\n## 4. Reporting accessibility problems with this app\n\nDon't remove this section. You always need to provide a way for users to report a problem with your app, even if it's public facing.\n\nIf this is a commercial app or part of it relies on a third-party vendor, be clear how this might impact the time it takes to fix accessibility problems.\n\n## 5. Enforcement procedure\n\nThis section is used to make clear how the accessibility of the app can be challenged.\n\nRemove the second paragraph if the statement will be published publicly online.\n\n## 6. Contacting us\n\nThis section is used to explain how people can contact the team that looks after the app. Change this section depending on your app and team.\n\nOnly reference the Service Desk if you've agreed that support route.\n\nWhere possible, the contact details you provide should point to a team or a group. This avoids a single point of failure if your point of contact were to leave their role.\n\n## 7. Technical information about this app's accessibility\n\nThis section is used to make a formal statement about how accessible the app is.\n\nThe form of words here are legally required, so **don't change it** except for adding in the name of Department.\n\n### 7(a). Compliance Status\n\nThere's a legally required way of expressing the compliance status of your app, so don't change any words. Delete the statements that don't apply.\n\n- If the app meets **all** Level A and Level AA success criteria of WCAG Level 2.1 then it's 'fully compliant'.\n- If the app meets **more than half** of the Level A and Level AA success criteria of WCAG Level 2.1 then it's 'partially compliant'.\n- If the app meets **less than half** of the Level A and Level AA success criteria of WCAG Level 2.1 then it's 'not compliant'.\n\nIf your app, service or product needs to meet the EN 301 549 standard, then use the above thresholds and insert the following sentence:\n_“This [product/website/app/service] is [fully/partially/not] compliant to the EN 301 549 standards.”_\n\nIt's likely that the WCAG standards also apply to EN 301 549 products, so retain the appropriate WCAG statement.\n\n## 8. Non-accessible content\n\nThis section is used to fully explain accessibility problems in the app.\n\nIf no section applies, you can delete this section. This section must be added later if accessibility problems are found because overall compliance will have changed.\n\n**Don't change or remove** the headings in this section. You can add subheadings to better format the lists of problems if needed.\n\n### 8(a). Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations\n\n<IcAlert\n  message=\"Delete the example in the template before publishing\"\n  variant=\"info\"\n/>\n\nThis section is used to list accessibility problems in your apps that need to be fixed.\n\nFor each accessibility problem, list:\n\n- A description of the accessibility problem.\n- The EN 301 549 or WCAG 2.2 success criteria that are partially or not supported because of the accessibility problem.\n- When the problem will be fixed. You must fix accessibility problems **within a defined timeframe.**\n\nDon't mention problems covered by a Disproportionate Burden or Regulation exemption.\n\nIf there are no accessibility problems, include the following sentence, amending as appropriate:\n_“There are no non-compliances with the accessibility regulations other than those in “Disproportionate burden\"/\"Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations\"\"_\n\n### 8(b). Disproportionate burden\n\n<IcAlert\n  message=\"Delete the example in the template before publishing\"\n  variant=\"info\"\n/>\n\nThis section is used if the app has an approved disproportionate burden assessment. Disproportionate burden assessments must always be approved by local accessibility owners.\n\nA disproportionate burden is a claim made when the Department can't reasonably fix or make the app accessible.\n\nIf the app does not need a disproportionate burden assessment, include the sentence:\n_“We're not claiming a disproportionate burden to making any part of [app name] compliant to the accessibility regulations.”_\n\n### 8(c). Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations\n\n<IcAlert\n  message=\"Delete the example in the template before publishing\"\n  variant=\"info\"\n/>\n\nThis section is used to list which parts of the app will not be made accessible because they're explicitly excluded in the Regulations. Refer to the Department's accessibility requirements for what is explicitly excluded.\n\nIf the app does not have content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations, include the sentence:\n_“There is no content in the app that is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations.”_\n\n## 9. How we tested this app\n\nThis section is used to explain how the app was tested against the relevant standard (WCAG or EN 301 549).\nThis includes which version(s) of the app were tested, where they are hosted and how pages were chosen for testing.\n\nIf relevant, include information from third-party auditors and reports that they have provided.\n\nThere is no requirement to test an app with a specific approach, but a combination of [manual and automatic techniques](/accessibility/testing) is recommended.\n\n## 10. What we're doing to improve accessibility\n\nThis section is used to explain how you will make sure that the app remains accessible through its lifecycle. Linking to a product or accessibility roadmap is optional, but it will help users understand what improvements will be made in future.\n\nWhere the app has existing accessibility problems, explain the timeframe in which the problems will be fixed.\n\n## 11. Preparation of this Accessibility Statement\n\nThis section is used to say when the latest accessibility testing was done, when this statement was updated and to link to relevant reports.\n\nThe wording in the first sentence about when the statement was prepared is legally required. **Don't change it.**\n\nInclude multiple Accessibility Conformance Reports if appropriate. The reports must match the latest app and this Accessibility Statement.\n\nInstances where multiple Accessibility Conformance Reports should be referenced:\n\n- The app consists of multiple interacting user interfaces.\n- The app is based on third party software that has been configured. Provide the vendor's Accessibility Conformance Report (VPAT/ACR) and then a supplementary report that covers any user interface changes caused by your configuration or customisation of the app.\n",

A small number of apps or services might need to meet the EN 301 549 standard. If that's the case, use that version of the Report instead.\n\nUse the full range of [accessibility testing](/accessibility/testing) methods to make sure your app or service is accessible to everyone. Just filling in a Report as a checklist won't give a full picture of how accessible (to WCAG or EN 301 549) your app or service is.\n\nIf an accessibility problem is found in the app or service that doesn't fit into the Report, it must be recorded in the Accessibility Statement.\n\n## Update as you go\n\nUpdate the Report during the lifecycle of the app or service.\n\nAutomated and manual accessibility testing is needed to fill in the Reports.

When filled in, the VPAT® becomes the app or service's Accessibility Conformance\n  Report.\n</p>\n\nUse the correct VPAT® depending on the type of app or service:\n\n- Use the [WCAG (VPAT®) template](/VPAT2.5WCAG-November2023.doc) for apps and services with only a user interface (browser-based or otherwise).\n\n- Use the [EN 301 549 (VPAT®) template](/VPAT2.5EU-November2023.doc) for apps and services that include hardware. It includes all the WCAG criteria, so only one Report is needed.\n\nIf a Report is produced or available from auditors or vendors, use their reports even if it's not called a 'VPAT®'.

Accessibility Conformance Reports must match the latest Accessibility Statement and app version.\n\nAll reports need to explain conformance to all WCAG or EN 301 549 success criteria or explain why it's not applicable.\n\n## How to fill in the report\n\nTo make the Report useful for everyone:\n\n- Update the Report as you do [manual](/accessibility/testing/manual-testing) and [automated accessibility testing](/accessibility/testing/automated-testing).\n- Write in plain English and avoid technical jargon so that everyone can understand it.\n- Ensure there is a Conformance Level and supporting comment in 'Remarks and Explanations' for each success criteria, even if it's 'not applicable'.\n- For any 'Supports' and 'Partially Supports' levels, explain why the app or service meets that specific success criteria.\n- For any 'Not Applicable' levels, explain why they aren't applicable to that specific success criteria.\n",

It's best to create them at the start of the project (or development).\n\nAn Accessibility Statement must always be available to users, even in a pilot or minimum viable product (MVP).\n\n## When to update\n\nUpdate the documentation during the lifecycle of the app or service. Whenever new features are added, tested and problems are found, they need to be reflected in the documentation.\n\nPublish the documentation when it changes. The documentation must be reviewed at least every 12 months even if the app or service has not changed.\n\n## Where to publish\n\nPublish the Accessibility Statement for apps and services in the following places:\n\n- As an accessible page, preferably available in the footer or navigation.\n- In any substantive corporate records for each department where the app or service is available.\n\nDepartments may also require statements to be published on their Intranet.\n\nThe statement must reflect and link to the latest Accessibility Conformance Report.\n",

Subtitles must not be embedded (rendered) into the video as they need to be readable using assistive technologies.\n\nDon't rely on automated subtitling and transcription because it might be inaccurate. Always check any automated subtitles and transcripts for accuracy.\n\nIncluding closed captions and transcripts on video or audio files will make the page accessible to those with hearing impairments.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={auditoryAccessibilityFig3}\n  imageAlt=\"A graphic of a video player with a show transcript button. On the right hand side there is a transcript window displaying the audio of the video in text format.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Include transcripts for audio elements where possible.\"\n/>\n\n### Varying points of contact\n\nWhen planning meetings, people may request multiple points of contact. For people with hearing impairments, communication via phone may not be suitable.\nIn these scenarios, providing multiple forms of contact will increase accessibility.\n\nThis can include interpreters for in person meetings, speech to text for virtual meetings and communication via messaging services.\n\n### Split content\n\nSplit larger chunks into smaller sections separated by headings.\nSmaller chunks are easier to read and less intensive compared to larger blocks of text.\n",

We have suggested the following design guidelines to be used when designing a page or service.\n\n### Large font\n\nWriting in a large font size will put less writing on a page and make the words more readable.\n\nAccessible font size recommendations can be found on the [typography styles page](/styles/typography) of this website.\n\nOur eyes are most often drawn to the larger text on a page. Less words on a page will feel like less effort to read.\n\n### Tabbing order\n\nAllowing people to use the tab button on their keyboard to navigate between elements on a page will improve accessibility.\nSome people are unable to use a mouse, so this option increases accessibility.\n\nThe default keyboard navigation order must be logical and follow the visual flow of the page — i.e. left to right, top to bottom.\n\n### Descriptive actions\n\nEnsure that actions describe their feature. Having a button or link that says ‘click here’ isn’t beneficial if ‘here’ isn’t specified.\n\nUsing descriptions stating exactly what the action does is more accessible.\n\n### Simple linear layouts\n\nEnsure data is displayed in a linear format that is readable for people. Don’t use confusing layouts.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={generalAccessibilityFig1}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of an information page currently at step 1 requiring an email address to be inputted and a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as to whether you wish to be contacted.

Being blamed can increase anxiety and stress which may affect other invisible needs.\nMake sure any error messages explain what needs to be done to fix the error.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={invisibleAccessibilityFig4}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of an error message and a submit button where the error asks the user to check data.

Some people that use walking frames can't hold a mobile phone, and some with muscle tremors may be unable to use dropdown menus with a mouse.\n\nThere are many types and causes of motor impairments. Over 400,000 people in the UK have rheumatoid arthritis and the number of people diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2018 in the UK was around one in 350 adults.\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fibromyalgia/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    id=\"fn-1\"\n  >\n    Read more about Parkinson's on the Parkinson's UK website\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  .\n</p>\n\n## Examples of motor impairments\n\nThe following table lists examples of motor impairments in three columns (permanent, temporary and situational).\n\n| Permanent                                                  | Temporary   | Situational           |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |\n| Missing a limb                                             | Broken limb | Holding a baby        |\n| Cerebral Palsy (affects muscle tone, movement and control) | Burn        | Using a telephone     |\n| Dyspraxia (co-ordination of movement)                      |             | General multi-tasking |\n| Muscle tremor (including Parkinson's)                      |             |                       |\n\n## How to design for motor needs\n\nIn addressing some of the design tips below, we make it easier for everyone to use our apps.\n\n### Clear clickable actions\n\nMake sure any interactive elements are clear and easily clickable. They should be easy enough to click and shouldn't be too close together.\n\nAvoid placing lots of actions next to each other as this could increase the risk of a user taking the wrong action.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={motorAccessibilityFig8}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a yes or no option and a submit button. The clickable areas include the text of the ‘yes’ radio option and the whole button.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"The cursors are positioned on a larger clickable area that includes the text for the button.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={motorAccessibilityFig9}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a yes or no option and a submit button with outlines around only the circle of the radio button and the chevron of the submit button, showing a limited clickable area.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"The cursors are positioned on a smaller clickable area that does not include the text for the button, making it harder for people with motor needs.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Design for keyboard and speech\n\nMake sure that all functionality is accessible by keyboard only. Some users with motor impairments may not use a mouse and instead use assistive technology such as speech input.\n\nConsider alternative input means (mouthpieces, clickers and text to speech software). Apps and services that conform to [WCAG](/accessibility/requirement/wcag) are more likely to work with assistive technologies.\n\n<p>\n  For example,{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.nuance.com/en-gb/dragon.html\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    id=\"fn-1\"\n  >\n    Dragon speech recognition software\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  allows users to navigate apps, browse desktops, open applications, type and\n  more.\n</p>\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={motorAccessibilityFig10}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a text field requiring user to enter a description with a dictate button for those who would prefer to use speech to text rather than typing.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Text field with an option to dictate what is written.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={motorAccessibilityFig11}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a text field requiring user to enter a description with only the option to type, which can be limiting for people with motor difficulties.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Text field that only has an option to type, which limits accessibility.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n",

These features often centre around differences in how people learn and process information.\n\nPeople with neurodiversity often describe themselves as having a different set of skills, abilities and ways of seeing the world.\n\n## Types of neurodiversity\n\nImproving a design for one set of needs often improves the experiences for other groups. It's quite common that some types of neurodiversity share needs with others.\n\nIt's important to remember that neurodiversity isn't always a disability or impairment. Neurodiverse people might not identify as having accessibility needs, but will still benefit from support and accessibility considerations.\n\nNot all types of neurodiversity and cognitive needs are included in these examples.\n\n### Dyslexia\n\nPeople with Dyslexia may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact other areas such as organisational skills.\n\n6.3 million people (around 10% of the UK population) have dyslexia.\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    id=\"fn-1\"\n  >\n    Read more about Dyslexia at the British Dyslexia Association\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n### Dyspraxia/Developmental Coordination Disorder\n\nDevelopmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, is a common disorder affecting fine and/or gross motor coordination in children and adults.\n\nMany non-motor difficulties may also be experienced. These include memory, perception and processing as well as additional problems with planning, organising and carrying out movements in the right order in everyday situations.\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk/about-dyspraxia/dyspraxia-glance/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Read more about Dyspraxia at the Dyspraxia Foundation\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n### Dyscalculia\n\nDyscalculia affects someone's ability to understand, recall or use numerical information. Some people may feel anxious when having to undertake any mathematical tasks.\n\nDyscalculia can also affect how numerical information is processed; some people can also have difficulty with memory, speed of thinking, organisation and sequencing. People with dyscalculia may not understand numerical references such as percentages.\n\n### Irlen Syndrome\n\nIrlen Syndrome is a perceptual processing disorder. It can affect what words and letters look like, including how well someone can read. It's distinct from dyslexia.\n\nIt can be the cause of unexplained symptoms such as headaches, eye strain and fatigue.\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.irlensyndrome.org/what-is-irlen-syndrome/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Read more about Irlen Syndrome at the Irlen Syndrome Foundation (US)\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n### Attention Deficit conditions\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) leads to difficulties in maintaining attention as well as impulsive and hyperactive behaviour.\n\nThe effects on people can include, but aren't limited to:\n\n- Trouble holding attention on tasks.\n- Avoidance or dislike of tasks that require a lot of mental effort.\n- Forgetfulness.\n- Trouble organising tasks and activities.\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://adhduk.co.uk/about-adhd/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Read more about ADD and ADHD at ADHD UK\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n### Spectrum conditions (including Autism and Asperger's)\n\nAutism (including Asperger's) is a spectrum condition that affects the way someone sees the world, processes information and interacts with others.\n\nIn the workplace, even when their qualifications and skill levels are ideally suited to the work concerned, someone may experience difficulties interacting with colleagues, and this can affect their ability to remain in employment. These may include:\n\n- Not understanding abstract concepts.\n- Needing extra time to process information or answer questions.\n- Over- or under-sensitivity to light and sound.\n\nAround 700,000 people in the UK are on the autistic spectrum. Only 16% of people with autism in the UK are in full time paid employment.\n\n<p>\n  Read more about{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/conditions-linked-learning-disability/autism-and-aspergers-syndrome\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Autism and Asperger's at Mencap\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  or{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    The National Autistic Society\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n## How to design for neurodiversity\n\nIn addressing some of the design tips below, we make it easier for everyone to use our apps.\n\n### Use colour properly\n\nSome people understand colour differently or may not be able to infer a relationship between colour and meaning.\n\nAlways use [accessible colour](/styles/colour) and never rely on colour alone to convey meaning.\n\n### Use graphics alongside text\n\nSome people find it easier to look at images. Use graphs, icons and colour alongside text to provide a different way to consume information.\n\nAll images and icons must use [accessible colour](/styles/colour) and have `alt` (alternate) text and captions.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={neurodiversityAccessibilityFig14}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a survey regarding eye colour.

Don't expect people to switch (or remember) between screens to see what they typed in previously.\n\n### Use simple words\n\nWhere possible, use [simple words](/styles/content-style/voice-and-tone) and aim for a maximum reading age of 9.\nPeople prefer to read pages with words they are already familiar with.\n\n### Allow browser customisations\n\nSome people rely on Operating System or Browser settings to change the colours of their apps.\nMake sure what you build can be used with platform settings.\n\nThese include Windows High Contrast mode, macOS increased contrast and browser extensions that modify CSS styles.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={neurodiversityAccessibilityFig16}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a dialogue box to show open-dyslexic text font, which is easier for people with dyslexia to read.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Open-dyslexic font is used to make text more readable for those with dyslexia.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={neurodiversityAccessibilityFig17}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a dialogue box to show default text font.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Default fonts might not always benefit people with dyslexia.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n",

It's updated whenever accessibility problems are raised, or when the user interface is changed.\n\nThe requirement applies differently to [older apps and services](/accessibility/requirement/meeting-the-policy) depending on when they were last modified.\n\nYou can't claim an exception to the Policy solely due to lack of time, knowledge or because accessibility wasn't prioritised.\n\n## How accessible is accessible enough?\n\nAssociated legislation provides the minimum expectation, but the Policy and Design System support teams in creating inclusive experiences above these minimum standards.\n\nHowever, it's not possible to guarantee an app or service is fully accessible to every possible user in every use case. There is no such thing as 'always 100% accessible'.\n\nApps and services will encounter accessibility problems during their lifecycle.\n\nTeams must transparently document non-conformance and known accessibility problems in their Accessibility Statements and Accessibility Conformance Reports. You must always include the date when you plan to fix the problem.\n\n## Policy and legislation\n\nIf you work for MI6, MI5 or GCHQ, search your intranet to learn more about our specific Policy Requirements.\n\nUnfortunately we can't currently publish the Policy online.\n\nThe guidance in the Design System is the source of truth for developing accessible apps and services, but it's not the Policy.

As such, manual review and/or a script of the conversation should be provided when you publish captions or transcripts.\n\n### Example of a bad automatic caption\n\nSpoken text: \"Broil on high for **4 to 5** minutes. You should **not** preheat the oven.\"\n\nAutomatic caption: \"Broil on high for **45** minutes. You should **know to** preheat the oven.\"\n",

Where possible, try to meet Level AAA too.\n\nBeing fully conformant to WCAG doesn't guarantee that your app or service is accessible to everyone. We use it as a good minimum standard, supported by enhanced requirements and responsive reporting processes.\n\nWhere applicable, there are around 70 criteria that an app or service needs to meet. Meeting them means the app or service is accessible in a number of ways and is generally implemented to accepted standards.

They may use a sense other than sight to browse. People may rely on assistive technology to present information in a different way, such as a screen reader or braille display.\n\nWCAG works to make sure your app is presented to assistive technologies in a way that gives a comparable experience to people who use them.\n\n### Operable\n\nWhen people can perceive your app, they need to be able to do something with it. Some people may have difficulties interacting with the keyboard or mouse due to motor difficulties. They may use one or the other, or another mechanism such as speech.\n\nWCAG checks for good keyboard navigation, no time limits and standard-compliant form fields.\n\n### Understandable\n\nOnce your app is perceivable and operable, make sure what is shown is understandable. An app that behaves unexpectedly or inconsistently is one that might stop people from understanding what it is or how to use it.\n\nWCAG checks that you use clear language in a way that signposts functionality. It also checks content for a hierarchy to make sure people who may not see your app can understand it.\n\n### Robust\n\nStandards such as WCAG, HTML5, CSS3 and good coding practices ensure technologies don't struggle with your service. Consider that when assistive technology fails, it's not always obvious to the user that something has ‘gone wrong’.\n\nWCAG checks some basic coding standards to make sure assistive technology can interact with your capability.\n\n## WCAG levels\n\nWCAG has three levels of conformance. The higher level of conformance your service has, the more people will benefit.\n\nThe impact of Level A criteria might be barely visible in an interface but Level AAA criteria will have a significant impact on the design.\n",

It's not always required to comply with the Policy but it’s a way to make a huge difference to people who use your apps and services.\n\nA wide range of assistive technologies are used by people. These often include screen readers, screen magnifiers, colour overlays and alternative input hardware.\n\n<p>\n  GOV.UK provides more{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assistive-technology-definition-and-safe-use/assistive-technology-definition-and-safe-use\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    examples and a definition of an assistive technology\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\nAs with any software release, users always find bugs, and some of those may be accessibility problems. However, by performing automated and manual accessibility testing, the severity of accessibility problems should reduce.\n\n## Screen readers and magnifiers\n\nPeople with [visual impairments](/accessibility/needs/visual) rely on different types of assistive technologies. Some people without visual impairments might also use these tools because they prefer them.\n\nThose that are blind, with little to no sight, depend on a screen reader to render a web page 'in text'. Once as text, this can be changed into other formats such as speech and braille.\n\nThe majority of visually impaired users have some sight or low vision and may rely on magnifiers that enlarge the screen content.\n\nTools used by visually impaired users include:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      JAWS\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    is a licensed screen reader for Windows.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.zoomtext.com/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      ZoomText\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    is a licensed magnifier for Windows.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/fusion/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Fusion\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    where Jaws and ZoomText are packaged together.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.nvaccess.org/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      NVDA\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    is a free and open-source screen reader for Windows.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://yourdolphin.com/en-gb/products/individuals/supernova-magnifier-screen-reader\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      SuperNova\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    is licensed and both a screen reader and magnifier for Windows.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://help.apple.com/voiceover/mac/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      VoiceOver\n    </ic-link>{\" \"}\n    is a screen reader built in into all Apple products.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Windows includes{\" \"}\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/11542/windows-use-magnifier-to-make-things-easier-to-see\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Windows Magnifier\n    </ic-link>\n    , a screen magnifier.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    MacOS includes{\" \"}\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh35715/mac\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Apple Zoom\n    </ic-link>\n    , a screen magnifier.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Design System recommends using NVDA and VoiceOver, depending on your platform, for screen reader testing.\n\nWhen testing with a screen reader, check that you can interact with all features and understand the content without looking at the screen.\n\nWhen testing with a magnifier, check that you can see and interact with all features easily without the need for excessive scrolling.\n\n## Voice control\n\nVoice control or speech recognition lets you navigate and control your computer with your voice alone.\n\nUsers include those with [dyslexia](/accessibility/needs/neurodiversity) who may have difficulty with spelling or are better at communicating verbally.

This includes checking for false positives and false negatives.\n\n## WCAG and context\n\nChecks in automated accessibility testing tools have a yes or no outcome. The biggest limitation of these automated tools is that they can't test for context.\n\n<p>\n  Deque’s{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web/guide\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Accessibility Developers' Guide\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  shows what type of testing is needed to meet{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"\"\n    href=\"/accessibility/requirement/wcag\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    WCAG 2.2 Level AA\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\nOf the 66 success criteria needed to meet WCAG AA, there are none that can be met fully with automated testing alone.\n\n## Usability\n\nIt's possible for an app to be WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliant but still have usability issues. Some of these usability issues may also be accessibility issues.\n\nUsability and context matter to everyone, including those with accessibility needs. Usability includes user experience, covering whether the tool is effective and efficient.\n\nManual accessibility testing, and other functional testing, is needed to make sure your apps or services are usable.\n\n## Example: colour contrast\n\nFor some success criteria, such as those around colour contrast, automated testing tools are vital.\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?showtechniques=141#contrast-minimum\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  requires the visual presentation of text and images of text to have a contrast\n  ratio of at least 4.5:1 (with exceptions).\n</p>\n\nAn automated testing tool can't test for context. For example, it can't tell you if the failing contrast ratio was one of the permitted exceptions, which does actually meet the success criteria, and so returns a false positive.\n\n## Example: alt text\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#text-alternatives\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Guideline 1.1 – Text Alternatives\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  requires you to provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it\n  can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille,\n  speech, symbols or simpler language.\n</p>\n\nMost automated accessibility checking tools will warn you if alternative text does not exist on images. However, automated tools can't tell whether the alternative text provided is useful and providing enough context of the image.\n\nIf the alternative text was a file name, such as `alt=\"picture1234.jpg\"`, this would make no sense to the reader.\n\nLikewise, an overly visual description of your app logo does does not provide the reader with the brand recognition, whereas the app name would.\n\nThe same image could also be used twice in the same page, but with different purposes, so the alternative text would need to reflect this.\n",

To check multiple pages, dialogs or other temporary elements, trigger them before re-running the test.\n\n## Linters\n\nTools called 'linters' analyse source code for a range of potential bugs. Some linters check for accessibility problems or have additional rulesets you can use.\n\nLinters detect issues very early and can prevent certain accessibility problems from ever being implemented.\n\n<p>\n  The{\" \"}\n  <ic-link target=\"\" href=\"/components\" rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\">\n    UI Kit\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  uses the ESLint accessibility plugin{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y\n  </ic-link>\n  .

Automated testing alone only finds between 30&ndash;50% of accessibility problems, so you have to do manual testing too.\n\n## What you need to do\n\nYour accessibility testing must include:\n\n- Using [automated browser testing](/accessibility/testing/automated-testing#browser-testing) regularly during development.\n- Conducting your own [keyboard-only testing](/accessibility/testing/manual-testing#keyboard-only-testing) for all parts of the app.\n- Conducting additional [manual testing](/accessibility/testing/manual-testing#full-manual-accessibility-testing) to account for limitations of automated accessibility testing.\n- Producing your own [documentation](/accessibility/documenting) of full, partial and non-conformances to the relevant accessibility standard.\n\n## Test as you develop\n\nTest as frequent as you can (ideally on every ticket and pull request). To help reduce the amount of accessibility problems you find in testing, you should update your development workflows to:\n\n- Use [linting](/accessibility/testing/automated-testing#linters) in any code to catch common problems introduced during development.\n- Consider using [integration testing](/accessibility/testing/automated-testing#integration-and-unit-testing) and [end-to-end testing](/accessibility/testing/automated-testing#end-to-end-testing).\n- [Test regularly with assistive technologies](/accessibility/testing/assistive-tech-testing), particularly the [NVDA screen reader](/accessibility/testing/assistive-tech-testing#testing-with-nvda).\n\n## Testing with real people\n\n<p>\n  You should aim to{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2018/03/20/why-accessibility-testing-with-real-users-is-so-important/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    design and test with real people\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  where possible.

This is a problem if libraries and frameworks you use are not accessible, where the options are to fix the component library or swap to a different one.\n\nSome reasons people might rely on a keyboard include:\n\n- People who are [blind](/accessibility/needs/visual) might use a screen reader and are generally unable see the cursor on the screen.\n- Users with [motor disabilities](/accessibility/needs/motor) may not have the fine motor movements required for using a mouse.\n- People with [chronic conditions](/accessibility/needs/motor), such as Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), may need to avoid using a mouse.\n- There are also power users who prefer to use the keyboard commands and shortcuts for speed and efficiency.\n\n<p>\n  WebAIM describes{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    how to test for keyboard accessibility\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Accessibility Insights\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  browser plugin, in FastPass mode, runs the automated checks and has a manual\n  check called \"Tab Stops\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  You can read more specific instructions for{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://dequeuniversity.com/mac/keyboard-access-mac\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    MacOS keyboard-only testing\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n## Full manual accessibility testing\n\nTo fully check for accessibility compliance, you need to work through the WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA criteria.\n\nThe WCAG requirements form the basis of the [Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)](/accessibility/documenting/conformance-report). The ACR is required when your app is released, but the more manual accessibility testing done during development the easier it will be to make your app meet the WCAG standards.\n\n<p>\n  The Web Accessibility Initative (WAI) has good documentation on{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    How to Meet WCAG\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  for each criterion.\n</p>\n\nFull manual testing is required on all the main pages of your app. Many apps use templates and common components so these only need to be tested the once with relevant variants to get full coverage.\n\n<p>\n  The Design System recommends the{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Accessibility Insights\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  browser plugin in Assessment mode.

The button uses `aria-expanded` so screen readers announce when the accordion panel is on display. `aria-controls` is also applied to the button to identify which expanded area is being controlled by the button.\n\nThe expanded content uses `aria-hidden`, which is set to `false` when the accordion is collapsed and `true` when expanded. The expanded content also has a `role` of `region` and `aria-labelled`, which links to the accordion heading within the button.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe accordion component is based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accordion Pattern, Aria Authoring Practice Guide (APG)\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed May 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/10/25/accordion-release.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessible ARIA Accordions, Scott O’Hara\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed May 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordion-icons/#:~:text=Using%20a%20caret%20is%20definitely,using%20no%20signifier%20at%20all\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accordion Icons: Which Signifiers Work Best?, Nielson Norman Group\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed May 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.aditus.io/patterns/accordion/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessible Accordion, Aditus\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed May 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/collapsible-sections/ \"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Collapsible Sections, Inclusive Components\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed May 2023.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Accordions are used to shorten the length of a page by hiding information.\r\n\r\nGroup accordions to hide more content on the page and to structure content into different sections.\r\n\r\nAn accordion group can be nested within another accordion to create one layer of nested content. Do not nest more accordion groups within an already nested accordion group. Only use one level of nesting.\r\n\r\n<ComponentPreview style={{ flexDirection: \"column\" }}>\r\n  <IcAccordionGroup label=\"Our coffees - Ingredients\">\r\n    <IcAccordion heading=\"Americano\">\r\n      <SlottedSVG\r\n        slot=\"icon\"\r\n        width=\"24\"\r\n        height=\"24\"\r\n        viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\r\n        fill=\"currentColor\"\r\n        xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\r\n      >\r\n        <path d=\"M2,21V19H20V21H2M20,8V5H18V8H20M20,3A2,2 0 0,1 22,5V8A2,2 0 0,1 20,10H18V13A4,4 0 0,1 14,17H8A4,4 0 0,1 4,13V3H20M16,5H6V13A2,2 0 0,0 8,15H14A2,2 0 0,0 16,13V5Z\" />\r\n      </SlottedSVG>\r\n      <IcTypography variant=\"body\">\r\n        A simple drink made by topping up espresso with hot water.\r\n      </IcTypography>\r\n    </IcAccordion>\r\n    <IcAccordion heading=\"Cappuccino\">\r\n      <SlottedSVG\r\n        slot=\"icon\"\r\n        width=\"24\"\r\n        height=\"24\"\r\n        viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\r\n        fill=\"currentColor\"\r\n        xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\r\n      >\r\n        <path d=\"M2,21V19H20V21H2M20,8V5H18V8H20M20,3A2,2 0 0,1 22,5V8A2,2 0 0,1 20,10H18V13A4,4 0 0,1 14,17H8A4,4 0 0,1 4,13V3H20M16,5H6V13A2,2 0 0,0 8,15H14A2,2 0 0,0 16,13V5Z\" />\r\n      </SlottedSVG>\r\n      <IcAccordion heading=\"Espresso\">\r\n        <IcTypography variant=\"body\">\r\n          Our tasty double shot of espresso made from the finest Arabica beans.\r\n        </IcTypography>\r\n      </IcAccordion>\r\n      <IcAccordion heading=\"Steamed milk\">\r\n        <IcTypography variant=\"body\">\r\n          Steamy milk how you like it.

Don’t display a title to achieve a title section with only the 'see all' or 'hide all' button.\r\n\r\nUse 'see all' and 'hide all' functionality to show or hide all information from all accordions at once.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={accordionFig2a}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A collapsed accordion group titled ‘Bari-star member benefits’ with a ‘see all’ button.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use the 'see all' button to open all accordions within an accordion group at once. \"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={accordionFig2b}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An expanded accordion group titled ‘Bari-star member benefits’ with a ‘hide all’ button.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use the 'hide all' button to close all accordions within an accordion group at once.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nAdd custom content to an accordion using the slotted section to create different uses for your accordions.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={accordionFig3}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An accordion titled ‘Order details’ including a three-row data list for a coffee order in the content area.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use the slotted content of an accordion to house other content.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nSet an accordion to open one at a time when the information in the accordions is unrelated.\r\n\r\nSet an accordion to open all at once when all information can be viewed at the same time and is related.\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nDo not use accordions when all information is critical to the people using the page.\r\n\r\nAvoid overusing accordions to hide all information on a page. Accordions may be ignored if used too frequently.\r\n\r\nDo not place accordion groups within nested accordion groups, one layer of nesting is the maximum.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={accordionFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An accordion group titled ‘Roasting hot’ containing an accordion group with another nested accordion group within it.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Do not nest an accordion or accordion group within an already nested accordion.

Accordions can also be placed within other components to organise content.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\n### Heading and title\r\n\r\nWhen using a title for an accordion group, make sure it is relevant to the information provided by each accordion header.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={accordionFig6}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An accordion group containing three accordions with headings of different types of tea, with a title of ‘Our coffee menu’\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Always make sure your title is relevant to your accordion group content.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nAlways give an accordion a suitable header that is relevant to the information that it contains.\r\n\r\nRelevant titles and headings allow people to skip over the information if it is not relevant.\r\n\r\n### Accordion content\r\n\r\nUse text content by default or use the accordion slot to provide custom content or layouts.\r\n\r\nDo not make accordion content scrollable as this will interfere with the page scroll.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={accordionFig7}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An accordion group with three accordions where the first accordion is expanded, containing a scroll bar.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Do not use scroll bars within accordions.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n### Icons\r\n\r\nUse an icon on an accordion header to provide additional meaning or to aid in recognition.\r\n\r\nMake sure that the icon is understandable and relevant to the accordion header and content.\r\n\r\nAlways provide alternative descriptions for icons if they aren't decorative. Only use icons if they are necessary, they are removed as default.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility considerations\r\n\r\nMake sure to change an accordion’s semantic heading style to achieve a logical heading structure on the page.\r\n",

If the alert appears on the page, it constitutes a status update. The `aria-live` region causes the alert to be brought to the attention of assistive technology users.\n\nBy default, the alert uses an `aria-live` value of `assertive` to interrupt the user flow to call attention to the status change.\n\nIf the alert content is not urgent, consider using an `aria-live` value of `polite` instead. This announces the alert contents after the current element announcement has been completed.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe alert component is based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Alert role, MDN Web Docs\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2017-04-04-how-to-make-inline-error-messages-accessible\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      How to make inline error messages accessible\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

This is where users expect to see the button and it's out of the way of most other page content and navigational elements.\n\nThe button targets the main landmark in order to move focus to the top of the content and not require keyboard users to tab through all other navigational components.\n\nWe’ve made sure the component is WCAG compliant with movable interaction and keyboard accessible elements. When using the back to top button, no motion is applied to the automatic scroll.\n\nThe icon-only variant was created to be more accessible on zoom, as the text label on the default variant may obscure page content. The addition of the tooltip allows the label to be displayed on hover or focus.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nEven for short screens, the recommendation is to use a back to top button as it provides people using assistive technology a way to quickly get back to the top of the content.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe back to top component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/back-to-top/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Back to top\n    </ic-link>\n    , Nielsen Normal Group, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/0ssw9k/proposed/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Scrollable element is keyboard accessible\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      2.3.3 Animation from interactions\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      2.1.1 Keyboard\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard-no-exception\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      2.1.3 Keyboard No Exception\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

These should always be supplementary methods of conveying the information as they can be hard for everyone to understand their meaning. It is always best to show the information the badge represents in full elsewhere so that it can be understandable by everyone.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nAs badges can be displayed or update due to a change in information, such as the number of new emails in an inbox, it is important to make this status change announced by a screen reader. Applying a live region will make sure that a screen reader will announce the change as it happens without requiring the element to be in focus.\n\nBadges allow an accessible label to be provided to add context to what is shown visibly. This can help people who use screen readers understand it better as they may not be able to perceive the visual context of the badge. For example, a badge showing 10 new notifications on an inbox button may be understandable to a sighted user from just the number ‘10’ on the visible label. However, it may aid a screen reader user to include ‘10 new notifications’ in its accessible label. Just make sure to always include the visible label within the accessible label.\n\n## Based on\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/indicators-validations-notifications/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Indicators, validations and notifications: Pick the correct communication\n      option\n    </ic-link>\n    , Nielsen Norman Group, published 26 July 2015, accessed August 2023\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

For example, use them to display an item count such as the number of new notifications, or to display an icon such as a padlock icon for locked content.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={badgeFig2}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app showing a top navigation bar that includes an icon button for messages. A badge is displayed on the messages icon button showing the number 8 in its label.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use text badges to draw attention to new information such as new messages in an inbox.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse text badges to attach short labels to other information. For example, a badge could be used to highlight a new item in a list. Remember to keep labels concise.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig3}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Use text badges to add short labels to other page elements.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"A list of cards showing coffee-themed blog posts. The top card has a text badge displaying the label ‘New’.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A list of cards showing coffee themed blog posts. The top card has a text badge displaying the label ‘Brand new content’.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Don’t use long labels in text badges.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nUse a dot badge to indicate that something has changed or updated without displaying a text label or icon.\r\n\r\nUse a text badge with numerical label to show the number of updates.\r\n\r\nFor example, use a dot badge to highlight that new comments are available to review, without giving the number of new comments.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig5}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A side navigation component with an icon button for accessing an inbox. The icon button shows a dot badge indicating that something is available in the inbox.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use dot badges as a subtle way to indicate the presence of something without using a text label or an icon.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nOnly use badges when the component that it is attached to allows navigation to where the information related to the badge is stored. For example, a button that navigates someone to their inbox may show a badge displaying the number of new notifications that can be found there.\r\n\r\nOne exception is when using icon badges to add additional meaning only. For example, use an icon badge with a padlock icon to indicate that something may be currently locked due to access rights.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig6}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A side navigation showing an icon button for accessing a trends page. An icon badge is displayed showing a closed padlock icon indicating that it can’t be accessed.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use icon badges to add additional information. Here a lock icon is used to indicate limited access rights to a feature of the app.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nUse badges to convey status, but make sure to use a status icon on the badge to provide a clear way of understanding the status. Don’t rely only on the colour of the badge to indicate status.\r\n\r\nFor example, use a success status dot badge to indicate that something has gone online, but always try to back up the status message with textual messaging elsewhere on the page.\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nDon’t use text badges as the only method of showing information, back the message up elsewhere. For example, show a toast notification for a new message whilst also adding a text badge to an inbox icon button.\r\n\r\nAvoid attaching badges to non-interactive components. Aim to attach a badge to components that allow navigation to the information that the badge relates to.\r\n\r\nDon’t use an icon badge as the only means of showing information on a non-navigational component. Always back up the message by including written messaging elsewhere on the page or showing feedback when the component is clicked.\r\n\r\nFor example, if using an icon badge with a lock symbol to indicate limited access to a navigation button, then allow the navigation button to still be clicked, but show a message stating that it is locked using a dialog or alert.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={badgeFig7}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app with a hero component with the title ‘Come and taste our cool beans.’ A text badge is attached to the title and shows the number 8.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don’t add badges to non-navigational components as it can be hard to understand what it means.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAvoid using badges as the only way of indicating status. Always show information about the status in full on the page that the badged component navigates to.\r\n\r\nDon’t use multiple badges to indicate many different statuses at the same time as it is hard to understand what the different statuses could mean. When using badges to convey status, use one type of status badge at a time.\r\n\r\nFor an application showing different system statuses, don’t place multiple status badges on a component to show separate information such as online status as well as system health status.\r\n\r\nFor example, on an app for displaying coffee orders to baristas, don’t show multiple status badges on a single order. Don't display a badge to indicate time since the order was placed as well as a badge to indicate remaining number of products.\r\n\r\nAvoid using badges with more than four characters, including the ‘+’ symbol. Use the ‘maxNumber’ property to limit what is displayed before a ‘+’ symbol is added. For example, this can be used to show ‘99+’ notifications.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={badgeFig9}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app with a top navigation showing an icon button for an inbox page. The inbox icon button shows a badge that reads ‘99+’.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Use the maxNumber property to limit large numbers in text badges and display a ‘+’ symbol instead.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Colour\r\n\r\nUse the different colour variations of badges to make sure it achieves at least 3:1 colour contrast ratio with its background.\r\n\r\nSpecify a custom colour for the badge, but take care to make sure the colour contrast requirements are met.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig10}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A secondary button on a white background showing a badge with a contrasting blue colour.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use high contrast badges so that they stand out against background colours.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig11}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A secondary button on a white background showing a badge with a light grey colour that has a low contrast. The badge is difficult to make out.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Don’t use colour combinations with low contrast ratios.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n## Sizing\r\n\r\nUse the same sized badge for the size of the component that the badge is attached to. For example, use a large sized badge with a large sized button.\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\nBadges are always positioned in the top right corner of the component they are attached to. Make sure the badge overlaps the border of the component by adjusting the badge’s positioning using the ‘far’ and ‘near’ positioning options. For square components use the ‘far’ positioning option, and for rounded components use the ‘near’ positioning.\r\n\r\nFor components that are adjacent to one another, such as tabs, use ‘inline’ badge positioning so that the badge sits in line with the component’s label.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig12}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A secondary button with a badge using ‘far’ positioning, a chip with a badge using ‘near’ positioning, and a tab bar containing a tab with a badge using ‘inline’ positioning.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use the badge positioning options to change where a badge is placed on a component.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nMake sure that it is obvious what the badge relates to. Only use badges when the component it is attached to is labelled clearly to indicate what the badge references. For example, a numeric badge on an inbox is easily understandable, whereas a numeric badge on a menu button may not be as clear as to what the badge represents.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig13}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An app showing a top navigation with an icon button for an inbox page. It shows a badge showing the number 5, representing the number of messages in the inbox.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use badges where it is understandable what they represent. In this example the badge clearly indicates 5 messages in the inbox.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={badgeFig14}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An app showing a menu button with a badge showing the number 5. It is not clear what the number 5 represents.\"\r\n    state=\"caution\"\r\n    caption=\"Avoid using them in cases where the badge’s meaning is difficult to understand. In this example it is not clear what the 5 in the badge represents.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nWhen using text badges, keep the text label short and only use a single word. Avoid using more than four characters on a text badge. For example, use a text badge to label something as ‘New’. Don’t use badges to add long labels; consider adding that information elsewhere instead.\r\n\r\nIf displaying numbers in a text badge, then set the ‘maxNumber’ property to limit the number of characters shown. This will show a ‘+’ symbol if the value is larger than the maxNumber.\r\n\r\nAlways provide an accessible label to add context to a badge’s label for the benefit of people who use a screen reader. Make sure to include any visible label within the accessible label.\r\n\r\nTake care when using icon badges so that the icon is immediately understandable to its context. Don’t use abstract or ambiguous icons as this will make it hard to understand what the badge represents.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility considerations\r\n\r\nAlways provide a badge with an accessible label to add context for people who use screen readers. For example, a text badge displaying the number 10 might have an accessible label that reads ‘10 new notifications’.\r\n\r\nWhen using an icon badge, make sure that the icon alt-text makes sense to its function and use the accessible label to add context.\r\n\r\nWhen setting a badge’s colour, make sure it meets the minimum contrast requirement of 3:1 for non-text elements.\r\n\r\nIf a badge is added to a page because of a status update, make sure that screen readers announce its presence by using a live region.\r\n",

Use breadcrumbs for apps that have a large number of pages within a complex structure.\r\n\r\nShow the current page’s parents, grandparents and other ancestors so that the user can easily move back up the hierarchy. Always show a link to the app’s homepage as the top-level link in the breadcrumb component.\r\n\r\nUse breadcrumbs as a secondary navigation option to supplement the app’s main navigation method.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={breadcrumbsFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Above the page header is a breadcrumb component with links to parent pages for ‘Coffees’, ‘Beverages’ and ‘Home’. This is separate from the site navigation.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"A breadcrumb providing a secondary method of navigation that supplements the main navigation from the top navigation.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse the ‘back breadcrumb’ for apps with simple structures that are only one or two levels deep. Show the current page’s immediate parent in the back breadcrumb link.\r\n\r\nUse a condensed breadcrumb to hide the middle steps between the page’s parent and the homepage. However, always allow the condensed breadcrumb to be expanded to show the full path.\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nDon’t use breadcrumbs as the primary method of navigating through an app’s pages. Always include a global navigation method to allow any page to be easily accessed from any other page.\r\n\r\nDon’t use breadcrumbs to show the history of recently visited pages. Only use breadcrumbs to show the location of the current page within an app’s structure.\r\n\r\nDon’t use breadcrumbs if the app’s structure is only one or two pages deep. Use the ‘back breadcrumb’ or use a different method to indicate the page’s position.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={breadcrumbsFig2}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Above the page header is a breadcrumb component with links to parent pages for ‘Coffee’ and ‘Home’.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don’t use breadcrumbs for apps with structures that are only one or two pages deep.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nDon’t include the current page as a link within the breadcrumbs. Instead use clear titling on the page itself to label the current page. If displaying the current page within the breadcrumb, then make sure it is not clickable.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={breadcrumbsFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app called ‘A whole latte love’ showing a page titled ‘Latte’. A breadcrumb exists in the page header that includes links to the current page ‘Latte’, and its ancestors ‘Coffee’, ‘Beverages’ and ‘Home’.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don’t include the current page as a link within the breadcrumb.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAvoid showing more than six levels in a breadcrumb. Consider your app’s information architecture and whether the site’s structure can be flattened. If this can’t be achieved, use hub pages as the first link in a breadcrumb, which themselves provide a method of returning back to the homepage.\r\n\r\n## Colour\r\n\r\nAlways use the default theme of breadcrumbs to ensure that the links are recognisable as links. However, use the light or dark theme with `monochrome={true}` if breadcrumbs are positioned on different coloured backgrounds to ensure good colour contrast.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={breadcrumbsFig4}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app called ‘A whole latte love’ that shows a page titled ‘Latte’. A hero banner sits at the top of the page with a dark blue background. A breadcrumb component that sits on top of the dark hero banner uses white styled links to achieve high contrast.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use contrast styling if using breadcrumbs on different coloured backgrounds.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nMake sure that the breadcrumb label is the exact title of the page it links to.\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\nAlways position breadcrumbs at the top of page content but below main navigation components such as the [top navigation](/components/top-navigation).\r\n\r\n## Related components\r\n\r\n- [Page header](/components/page-header)\r\n",

Use them for the most important action on a page or within a container.\n\n### Secondary buttons\n\nUse secondary buttons to provide medium emphasis for less important actions on a page or within a container.\n\nGroup these buttons to provide a set of actions of equal priority.\n\n### Tertiary buttons\n\nUse tertiary buttons to provide low emphasis for low priority actions on a page or within a container that aren't important or used frequently.\n\nUse tertiary buttons for dismissive actions such as to close a dialog, navigate back a step or to cancel an action.\n\n### Destructive buttons\n\nUse destructive buttons for actions that can't be reversed. For example, use them for a delete action that can't be undone.\n\n### Icon buttons\n\nIcon buttons work like a normal button but don't include a visible text label. Use them to provide a compact method of triggering an action.\n\nUse icon buttons for well understood actions that are represented clearly by the icon's visual content. For example, a 'bin' icon indicates a delete function. Read more about [iconography](/styles/icons) for guidance on selecting and creating icons.\n\nAlways provide a textual description available programmatically and a visible label that is displayed using a tooltip when hovering on an icon button.\n\n## When not to use\n\n### Buttons and links\n\nButtons should trigger actions and affect content on the current page or container. To navigate to a new page or open a new tab use links instead.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={buttonFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"An example page showing a primary button labelled 'submit' at the bottom of a page.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use buttons to complete actions on the page such as adding or deleting an item, confirming or closing a dialog, or as a tool in a toolbar.\"\n/>\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={buttonFig2}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of a page with a hero banner with the title 'Today's good mood is sponsored by coffee.' A secondary button is displayed on the hero banner acting as a link to a new page called 'Get some coffee'.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don't use buttons to navigate users to a new page.\"\n/>\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nWhen an action triggers a background task, use the button loading state to provide feedback to the user that something is happening.\n\n<ComponentPreview style={{ gap: \"0.5rem\" }}>\n  <IcButton variant=\"secondary\" loading>\n    Loading\n  </IcButton>\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n## Colour\n\nDon't change a button colour as this makes them less recognisable as actions.\n\n### Appearance\n\nPrimary, secondary, tertiary and icon buttons have default, light and dark appearance options.\n\nUse different button appearances when placing buttons on coloured backgrounds to ensure good contrast and avoid colours clashing. Use light appearance buttons on dark backgrounds and use dark appearance buttons on light backgrounds.\n\nWhen you use the UI Kit components together they will select the appropriate variant.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig3}\n    imageAlt=\"Button variants on a white background, dark button variants on light coloured backgrounds, and light button variants on dark backgrounds.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use different appearance options on different coloured backgrounds to ensure good contrast and avoid colours clashing.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig4}\n    imageAlt=\"A bad example showing dark button variants used on a white background, coloured button variants on coloured backgrounds, and dark button variants on dark backgrounds.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Use the correct button appearance to meet minimum contrast requirements.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Sizing\n\nButtons have three different sizing options: default, small and large.\n\nUse components of the same size together. For example, use a default sized button with a default sized input component, or use a small sized button with a small sized input component.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig5}\n    imageAlt=\"A form with correctly sized components. A normal sized input component is paired with normal sized button, and a small sized input component is paired with a small sized button.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use the correct buttons sizes to match other UI component sizes.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig6}\n    imageAlt=\"A form with incorrectly sized components. A normal sized input component is paired with small sized button, and a small sized input component is paired with a normal sized button.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don't mix different sized components.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nUse large buttons only for high emphasis actions that sit independently from other UI elements.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={buttonFig7}\n  imageAlt=\"A page showing a large sized button on its own at the bottom of the page content.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use large buttons for standalone, higher priority actions.\"\n/>\n\n## Layout and placement\n\n### Button hierarchy\n\nUse only one primary button on a page or within a container. Show the most important action with a primary button.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig8}\n    imageAlt=\"A dialog box reading 'Are you sure you want to continue?' using a primary button for the important 'continue' action and a tertiary button for the lower priority 'Go back' dismissive action.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use a primary button for the most important action or when you want to influence an action.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig9}\n    imageAlt=\"A dialog box reading 'Are you sure you want to continue?' using one primary button for the 'Continue' action and another primary button for the 'Go back' action.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Two primary buttons make it less clear what the expected action is.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nUse secondary buttons to perform secondary or lower priority actions.\n\nGroup multiple secondary actions to provide a set of possible actions with an equal priority.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig10}\n    imageAlt=\"A dialog reading 'How would you like to continue?' showing a single primary button for the 'save' action and two secondary buttons for the 'save as...' and 'duplicate' actions.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use multiple secondary buttons to provide lower priority actions, whilst using a primary button for the higher priority action.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig11}\n    imageAlt=\"A dialog that reads 'Are you sure you want to continue?' showing a primary button for the 'continue' action, as well as a tertiary button providing the dismissive 'Go back' action.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use tertiary buttons to provide a dismissive or cancellation action when paired with a primary button that provides the main call to action.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Button grouping\n\nGroup buttons to provide a set of actions.\n\nHighlight the primary action in the group using a primary button. Use all secondary or all tertiary buttons for the rest of the actions.\n\nDon't mix secondary and text buttons to provide multiple actions in a group.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={buttonFig12}\n  imageAlt=\"An example page showing a button group containing a primary button indicating the main ‘Submit’ call to action and two secondary buttons for the lower priority ‘Duplicate’ and ‘Save as’ options.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use a primary button to highlight the key action in a button group.\"\n/>\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={buttonFig13}\n  imageAlt=\"An example page showing a button group comprised of a tertiary button for the ‘Cancel’ action, a destructive button for the ‘Delete’ action, a secondary button for the ‘Save as’ action and a primary button for the ‘submit’.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don’t use different button types for different actions in a group.\"\n/>\n\nPlace primary buttons on the left of a button group unless presented in a modal window where they should be located on the right. This follows common reading patterns when viewing a page and a dialog.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={buttonFig14}\n  imageAlt=\"An example page showing a button group positioned in the main page content aligned to the left of the page. The group has a primary button positioned on the left and two secondary buttons to its right.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Position primary buttons to the left when on a page.\"\n/>\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={buttonFig15}\n  imageAlt=\"A dialog showing a button group positioned to the right. The group has a primary button positioned on the right of the group and two secondary buttons on its left.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Position primary buttons to the right when on a dialog.\"\n/>\n\n## Content\n\n### Labels\n\nFollow the [content style](/styles/content-style) guidelines when writing button labels.\n\nAdd useful labels to buttons so that they don't rely on context. Avoid using long labels and keep them specific and concise.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig16}\n    imageAlt=\"A dialog with the heading ‘Are you sure you want to continue?’. There are two buttons in the modal with labels which read ‘go back’ and ‘continue’.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use concise but specific labels.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig17}\n    imageAlt=\"A dialog with the heading ‘Are you sure you want to continue?’. There are two buttons in the modal with labels which read ‘No, take me out of here’ and ‘yes, continue to the next section’.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use long labels or generic labels.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nAlways specify an accessible label for the button. The accessible label can include more detail than is described in the visible label, but make sure that the visible label text is included within the accessible label.\n\nFor example, a button may have a visible label that reads ‘Submit’. The accessible label may read ‘Submit form’. This includes more information to aid assistive technology users, but still includes the full visible label.\n\n### Icons\n\nUse an icon on a button to provide additional meaning or to aid in recognition. All button types can display an icon.\n\nMake sure that the icon is understandable and relevant to the action.\n\nAlways provide alternative descriptions for icons if they aren't decorative. Only use icons if they are necessary.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig18}\n    imageAlt=\"A set of buttons with icons that clearly relate to the action. The icons used are a circle arrow for refresh, a floppy disk for save, a back arrow for go back, and a bin for delete.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use icons with clear meaning to add clarity to the action.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={buttonFig19}\n    imageAlt=\"A set of buttons with icons that are unrelated to the action. The icons used are a Christmas tree for refresh, a padlock for save, a box rectangle for go back and a box cross for delete.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use complicated, unrelated or ambiguous icons on buttons.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nAdd labels to all icon buttons using a [tooltip](/components/tooltip), which is useful to sighted users too.\n\nUse useful and context-free labels. If necessary, add additional context in the accessible label.\n\n## Related components\n\n- [Links](/components/link)\n- [Tooltips](/components/tooltip)\n",

Clickable cards act as links, and therefore inherit the accessibility features of links.\r\n\r\n## For Assistive Technology\r\n\r\nScreen readers should always read the heading first, even when an image is placed at the top of the card. To achieve this, we've re-ordered content using CSS Flexbox layout so that visually the image appears first but is placed after the heading section in HTML.\r\n\r\nThe container of interactive and static cards is not clickable, and therefore is not focusable. When navigating within the page, the focus switches between the different interactive components of the card.\r\n\r\nIn the case of clickable cards, since the whole area is interactive, then the whole container is focusable.\r\n\r\nClickable cards inherit the accessibility features of the link style, using an `<a href=\"\">` to wrap the whole component.\r\n\r\nProvide as much detail as possible to the purpose of any link or button present within interactive cards, or to the action of a clickable card. If you can't show this within the component, use the `class=”visuallyhidden”` to add descriptive text about the purpose of the call to action(s).\r\n\r\nWhen cards are arranged in group, these should be placed within an unordered list `<ul>`, with each card marked as a list item `<li>` to provide navigational cues for screen readers.\r\n\r\n## Based on\r\n\r\nThe cards component has been based on the following resources:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <ic-link\r\n      target=\"_blank\"\r\n      href=\"https://www.nomensa.com/blog/how-build-accessible-cards-block-links\"\r\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\r\n    >\r\n      How to build accessible cards-block links\r\n    </ic-link>\r\n    , Joel Strohmeier, accessed May 2022.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <ic-link\r\n      target=\"_blank\"\r\n      href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/block-links-cards-clickable-regions-etc.html\"\r\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\r\n    >\r\n      Block Links, Cards, Clickable Regions, Rows, Etc.\r\n    </ic-link>\r\n    , Adrian Roselli, accessed May 2022.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <ic-link\r\n      target=\"_blank\"\r\n      href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/card\"\r\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\r\n    >\r\n      Cards\r\n    </ic-link>\r\n    , Inclusive components, accessed May 2022.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <ic-link\r\n      target=\"_blank\"\r\n      href=\"https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/section-cards.html\"\r\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\r\n    >\r\n      Cards\r\n    </ic-link>\r\n    , A11y style guide, accessed May 2022.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <ic-link\r\n      target=\"_blank\"\r\n      href=\"https://bbc.github.io/gel/components/card/\"\r\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\r\n    >\r\n      Cards\r\n    </ic-link>\r\n    , BBC, accessed May 2022.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nWe've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

The container itself is not interactive but can have interactive components.\r\n\r\n### Clickable cards\r\n\r\nClickable cards provide a single action that is triggered by clicking anywhere on the card.\r\n\r\n### Static cards\r\n\r\nStatic cards are non-interactive and contain static content only.\r\n\r\n## Anatomy\r\n\r\nThe following section describes the different areas of content on a card.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={cardsFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A diagram showing the positioning of the different areas within a card. The areas are a heading area, an image area, a content area, an interaction area, and an expandable area.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"A card includes a heading area, an image area, a content area, an interaction area and an expandable area.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### 1. Heading area\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={cardsFig2}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A diagram showing the positioning of the different sections within the heading area. The area is split up into three different rows. The first row houses section 'A' on the left, section 'B' in the middle, and section 'E' on the right. The second row houses section 'C', and the third row houses section 'D'.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"A card's heading area includes five elements.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThe heading area can contain:\r\n\r\n- A: Icon/Avatar\r\n- B: Heading\r\n- C: Subtitle\r\n- D: Adornment, for example [status tags](/components/status-tag)\r\n- E: More options icon button (only for interactive cards)\r\n\r\n### 2. Image\r\n\r\nInclude an image either at the top or in the middle of the card. Don't place images below content if this is included in the card.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={cardsFig3}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Two example cards vertically aligned, where the top card displays an image above the heading area and content area, and the bottom card displays an image below the heading area and above the content area.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Place images either at the top or in the middle of cards if content is present.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={cardsFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example card where an image is displayed below the heading and content area.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Don't place images below content.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n### 3. Content area\r\n\r\nAdd a descriptive message within the card content section. Interactive and static cards can include a 'see more' link to expand hidden content.\r\n\r\nSince clickable cards can only contain one interaction, text can't be hidden.\r\n\r\n### 4. Interaction area (interactive cards only)\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={cardsFig5}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A diagram showing the positioning of the different sections within the interaction area. The area features one row with two different sections, 'A' on the left and 'E' on the far right.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"A card's interaction area includes two elements.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAdd interactive components to the interaction area at the bottom of the card (A). Avoid using too many interactions. The interaction area is only found in interactive cards.\r\n\r\nUse any type of button in the interaction area to provide actions.\r\n\r\nInclude an expand button (E) if you include content in the [expandable area](/components/card#5-expandable-area-interactive-cards-only).\r\n\r\n### 5. Expandable area (interactive cards only)\r\n\r\nUse an expandable area to hold content that either doesn't fit in the collapsed card or doesn't align to the above areas.\r\n\r\nThis area can be expanded by clicking the “expand” button found on the interaction bar.\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\n### Grouping\r\n\r\nWhen arranging multiple cards together, try to use the same card variant for each.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={cardsFig6}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An image showing a three static cards, one interactive card, and one clickable card arranged in a group.\"\r\n  state=\"caution\"\r\n  caption=\"Avoid mixing card variants when arranged in a group.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Sizing\r\n\r\nWhen cards are shown in columns, make sure cards are vertically aligned and maintain the same width for all cards.\r\n\r\nWhen arranging cards in rows, try to match the vertical height of the cards by including similar amounts of content so that they automatically align horizontally.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={cardsFig7}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An image showing six cards arranged into three rows and two columns, and the width of the cards changes for each row.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don't vertically align cards with different widths.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nKeep headings, subheadings and adornments clear and concise.\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\nUse the pre-defined aspect ratios for images in cards. These are:\r\n\r\n- 16:9\r\n- 1:1\r\n- 9:16\r\n- 4:1\r\n- 4:3\r\n- 3:4\r\n\r\nSet an image to fit within the image container to show the whole image, but this may introduce empty areas in the image container if the image does not match the container aspect ratio. Alternatively, set the image to fill the image container, but be aware this may crop some of the image’s content.\r\n\r\nUse a custom image aspect ratio if your image doesn't fit into one of the pre-defined options.\r\n\r\nImages should always feature an `alt` attribute. Set the `alt` equal to a descriptive alternative when an image is informational.\r\n\r\n### Content area\r\n\r\nIf placing several lines of text in the content area, use a 'see more' link to make the content expandable.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={cardsFig10}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example card titled ‘Your order' with two rows of content in the content area. The second line displays truncated content and a 'see more' clickable text button.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use a ‘see more’ link when adding long text to the content area.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={cardsFig11}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example card titled 'Your order' with nine rows of content in the content area.\"\r\n    state=\"caution\"\r\n    caption=\"Avoid displaying lengthy descriptions in the content area.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n## Custom cards\r\n\r\nCards can also be used as custom containers if the pre-defined options don't meet your needs. When designing a custom card, make sure to respect the general anatomy and structure of cards as defined in this document.\r\n\r\nAny interactive components must be placed either within the interaction bar, or the expandable area. Make sure the interactive area is always placed at the bottom of a collapsed card.\r\n\r\nCards support one single image. If you need to place two or more images, place the additional images in the expandable area.\r\n\r\nDon't include any interactive components within a clickable card as these will interfere with the clickable card’s own action.\r\n",

The checkbox is then checked using the **space** key when the field is focused.\n\nWhen child fields are displayed beneath checkboxes, the field acts as the child of the checkbox. The field should be included within the focus order so that it's focused directly after the checkbox it belongs to.\n\nWhen a child field is dynamically displayed after checking a checkbox, then it should be announced as required due to the user’s selection.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nThe label of a checkbox group is announced by a screen reader before the checkbox options are announced.\n\nScreen readers will read out the label of the checkbox as well as whether it's checked or not.

Checkboxes are grouped into a checkbox group to provide multiple options. Any number of options can be selected and any type of checkbox can be included within the checkbox group.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig1}\n    imageAlt=\"A checklist asking the question ‘What are your favourite types of coffee?’ with six options where two are checked.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use the checkbox group to provide a number of options that can be selected.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nUse a single checkbox on its own to allow a user to agree with a statement. For example, use a single checkbox to allow a user to mark whether they agree to a terms and conditions statement.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig2}\n    imageAlt=\"A single unchecked checkbox with a label that reads “I agree to the terms and conditions, and privacy statement”.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use single checkboxes to allow a person to agree to a statement.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nUse a checkbox with a conditional field to display a related additional element when that checkbox is selected. The conditional field can be set to static so that it is always visible and becomes enabled once the checkbox is selected. If the conditional field is set to dynamic the field is displayed only when the checkbox is selected.\n\n## When not to use\n\nDon’t use checkboxes when only one option from a list can be selected. For single select lists, use [radio buttons](/components/radio).\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nCheckboxes have three possible selection states: selected, unselected and indeterminate.\n\nDisplay the indeterminate selection state when the selection of child elements is mixed.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig3}\n    imageAlt=\"A checkbox group asking ‘Which hot drinks do you like?’. A checkbox with label ‘coffee’ shows its indeterminate state as only one of its two child checkboxes is selected.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"A nested checkbox group that shows an indeterminate state on a parent checkbox when only some of its children are selected.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nCheckboxes are selected or unselected by clicking any part of the checkbox, including the label.\n\n### Sizing\n\nUse small sized checkbox groups for compact layouts. Always use small components with other small input components.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={checkboxFig4}\n  imageAlt=\"Two forms containing a checklist and a text input. One uses default sizing resulting in larger spacing between components. The other uses small sizing that reduces space between components and results in a shorter vertical height for the same form.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use small sizing for compact layouts.\"\n/>\n\n### Validation\n\nThere are two types of error that can occur on a checkbox: a checkbox input error or an error on a checkbox’s conditional field.\n\nA checkbox input error is when the checkbox or checkbox group component itself is responsible for the error. This is shown using the checkbox error state.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig5}\n    imageAlt=\"A checklist asking 'What are your favourite types of coffee?' with helper text stating 'Select at least one'. Six options are shown but all are unchecked. An error message is displayed below the checklist reading 'Please select at least one option'.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Checkbox group error state shown correctly.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig6}\n    imageAlt=\"An unchecked checkbox with label 'I agree to the terms and conditions and privacy statement' alongside a submit button. An error state is shown after the checkbox reading 'Please agree before continuing'.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Single checkbox error state shown correctly.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nFor errors on a checkbox’s conditional field, the error is shown only on the conditional field itself and not the wider checkbox or checkbox group component.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig7}\n    imageAlt=\"A checklist asking ‘What are your favourite types of coffee’. Six options are shown and one labelled ‘Flat white’ is selected and shows a conditional field that asks ‘How frothy do you like it?’. An error message is displayed below the conditional field reading ‘Please provide an answer’.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Checkbox conditional field error shown correctly.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig8}\n    imageAlt=\"A checklist asking ‘What are your favourite types of coffee?’. Six options are shown and one labelled ‘Flat white’ is selected and shows a child field that asks ‘How frothy do you like it?’. An error message is displayed below the child field reading ‘Please provide an answer’. Another error message is displayed below the checklist repeating the same error message.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Checkbox conditional field error shown incorrectly. Only the field needs to show the error state and not the parent checkbox or checkbox group.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Content\n\n### Labels\n\nFollow the [content style guidelines](/styles/content-style) for checkbox group labels as well as each individual checkbox label. Use the checkbox group label to ask the question, and use the checkbox options to provide possible answers.\n\nMake sure to use labels that make it easy to understand what selecting the checkbox represents. Avoid using ambiguous labels that make it unclear whether to select a checkbox or not.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig9}\n    imageAlt=\"A short form asking the user to agree to the terms and conditions. A single unchecked checkbox with label ‘I agree to the terms and conditions and privacy statement’ is shown alongside a submit button.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use clear and concise wording in checkbox labels that makes it easy to understand what selecting the box represents.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={checkboxFig10}\n    imageAlt=\"A short form asking the user to agree to the terms and conditions.

However, the visible label must be included within the accessible label.\n\nWhen an interactive chip is disabled, the `aria-disabled` tag is set to `true`.\n\nMake sure that focus is moved to an intuitive element of the page after a chip is dismissed.\n\nWhen an icon is slotted into a chip, ensure it either has an accessible label provided through alt text on an `<img>`, a title element within an `<svg>`, or an `aria-label`. If the icon is purely decorative, use `aria-hidden=true` to hide it from assistive technology.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nDismissible chips use the role of button as opposed to link in order to help users of assistive technologies understand that the button is performing an action on the page instead of navigating them to a new location. Users should be aware that activating the button will remove the chip from the list.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe chips component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      ARIA: button role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN web docs, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/pills/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Pills\n    </ic-link>\n    , Lightning Design System, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/chips/accessibility/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessibility in Angular Chips component\n    </ic-link>\n    , Syncfusion, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/button/chiplist/accessibility/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessibility: WAI-ARIA support\n    </ic-link>\n    , KendoReact, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Dismissible chips have both filled and outline variants and are interactive, whereas static chips simply present information and aren't actionable.\n\n### Dismissible chips\n\nUse a dismissible chip to show selected data from a user action that can be cleared by dismissing the chip. This is often used in the context of filtering and selection.\n\n#### Filled\n\nUse filled dismissible chips to provide high emphasis on the displayed information.\n\n#### Outlined\n\nUse outlined dismissible chips to provide low emphasis on the displayed information.\n\n### Static chips\n\nUse static chips to display information that does not need clearing. They aren't interactive, so they don't present any action and they can't be dismissed.\n\n## When to use\n\n### Dismissible chips\n\nUse dismissible chips when you need to choose multiple items from a list but need to show items after they've been chosen.\n\nCommon use cases include:\n\n- A list showing which filters have been selected for a search.\n- Choosing multiple recipients of a message.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={chipsFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"A correct example of a series of dismissible chips being used in a multi-select dropdown to display a list of selected items.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use dismissible chips for filtering multiple items.\"\n/>\n\n### Static chips\n\nUse static chips when you need to simply display a piece of information with no interaction, such as a label.\n\nCommon use cases include:\n\n- Labelling or drawing attention to a particular card or row because of its state.\n\n- Displaying the current location of an item.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={chipsFig2}\n  imageAlt=\"A correct example of three static chips labelled 'Published 18 May 2021', '#UI', and '#Components' right below the header of a page titled 'Guidance'.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use static chips to display descriptive, non-interactive information.\"\n/>\n\n## When not to use\n\n### Dismissible chips\n\nDon't use dismissible chips where the user can't re-select the item presented in the chip.\n\nFor example, if used to show a selected filter, after dismissing the chip and clearing the filter, it can be applied again later.\n\n<video\n  width=\"100%\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"An animation showing the user dismissing a chip labelled 'Roasted' and the option not re-appearing in the filter section.\"\n>\n  <source src={chipsVid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nDon't use dismissible chips when the user will not be able to re-select the dismissed item.\n\n<video\n  width=\"100%\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"An animation showing the behaviour of a dismissible chip as it re-appears in the filter section when the user dismisses it.\"\n>\n  <source src={chipsVid2} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nAllow users to re-select the item after it has been dismissed.\n\n### Static chips\n\nDon't use static chips to show status.

For example, if hovering day input, people can use the arrow keys to increase or decrease the day.\n\nPressing tab and shift tab will move the cursor between day, month and year. Pressing forward slash or dash (hyphen), will move the cursor from left to right as these are commonly used date separators.\n\nPeople can copy and paste into a date input component to quickly input a date into the date input field.\n\n## For assistive technology\n\n### Screen readers\n\nTo aid people in understanding how to navigate through a date input, the label, helper text and date input description are initially read out. The description announced for the date input includes the date format (if there is custom helper text) and how to add values using the arrow keys.\n\nWhen selecting the day using the arrow keys, the day and then the phrase 'day' is announced, for example \"01, day\".\n\nWhen selecting the month using arrow keys, the following message is announced, \"01 – January, month\".\n\nWhen selecting the year using arrow keys, the year and phrase 'year' are announced. For example, \"2024, year\".\n\nIf further updates to the input are made once day, month and year have been set, the screen reader will announce \"Selected date: _date changed to_\". For example, if the input was changed from 01/01/2023 to 02/01/2023, it will announce \"Selected date: Monday 2, January 2023\".\n\n## Based on\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/concurrent-input-mechanisms.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Concurrent input mechanisms\n    </ic-link>\n    , Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, World Wide Web Consortium,\n    published 05 October 2023, accessed February 2024.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#identify-input-purpose\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Identify input purpose\n    </ic-link>\n    , Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, World Wide Web Consortium,\n    published 05 October 2023, accessed February 2024.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#input-modalities\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Input modalities\n    </ic-link>\n    , Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, World Wide Web Consortium,\n    published 05 October 2023, accessed February 2024.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#input-assistance\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Input assistance\n    </ic-link>\n    , Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, World Wide Web Consortium,\n    published 05 October 2023, accessed February 2024.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

For example, use a date input when asking for a person’s birthday as it may be quicker than navigating through a [date picker](/components/date-picker).\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig1}\n    imageAlt=\"A date input being used to select a birthday\"\n    caption=\"Use a date input to collect distant dates.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## When not to use\n\nDo not use a date input when asking for parts of a date where some elements may not be known. For example, knowing the month and year, but not the day. Instead, consider using three separate fields for date, month and year, and set all to optional.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig2}\n    imageAlt=\"Three separate date inputs being used to capture day month and year independently.\"\n    caption=\"Three separate input fields can be used when capturing partial dates.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Content\n\n### Labels\n\nUse [content styling](/styles/content-style/principles) for help with building effective labels for people using date input.\n\n### Helper text\n\nUse helper text to provide additional information.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig3}\n    imageAlt=\"An example of the benefits of using helper text in a date input.\"\n    caption=\"Use helper text to give context to the current required input.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig4}\n    imageAlt=\"An example of a date input with no helper text included.\"\n    caption=\"Avoiding helper text removes context.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Date formatting\n\nUse the date input `dateFormat` property to change the default input format between DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY and YYYY/MM/DD. Use differing labels on the helper text and within a date input, when catering for regional input preferences.\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nUse the `disablePast` property when using date input to gather information about future dates, such as hotel bookings.\n\nUse the `disableFuture` property when using a date input to gather information about days in the past, such as birthdays.\n\nSet the default date on a date input to help people quickly complete the input by sticking with the default value. For example, set the default date to the next available delivery date when asking for a delivery date preference.\n\nDo not use default date when using date input to collect a date far in the past. For example, do not use “now” as default when asking for date of birth. Instead, use placeholder text of date format until the user selects their input.\n\nUse `html autofocus` to automatically focus a date input when it is the only input on a page.\n\nDo not use `html autofocus` on a date input when it is part of a form with other inputs.\n\nYou can copy and paste a complete date into the date input.\n\n## Sizing\n\nUse the date input size properties to change its vertical size and achieve compact or spacious layouts.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig5}\n    imageAlt=\"A date input matching the height of the button component next to it.\"\n    caption=\"Adjust a date input’s size properties to help it match the rest of your form.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig6}\n    imageAlt=\"A date input that is larger than the button component it is next to.\"\n    caption=\"Don’t mix different sized components.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Width\n\nEnsure the width of the date input allows enough space for the full length of a person’s potential input.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig7}\n    imageAlt=\"A date input matching the width of its expected input.\"\n    caption=\"Where appropriate to form size, adjust the width of a date input to match other elements.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig8}\n    imageAlt=\"A date input matching the width of other elements in a form.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={fig9}\n  imageAlt=\"A date input matching the width of a much longer form element.\"\n  caption=\"Avoid matching a date input to considerably wider form elements.\"\n  state=\"caution\"\n/>\n\n## Validation\n\nUse validation on input fields to tell people when any warning or errors occur within their input. The date input component offers some standard validation scenarios as well as a method for creating custom validation scenarios.\n\nUse the custom validation options to configure your own validation scenarios. For example, if it is required that the input date must be after another specific date then use an error validation message if the input date doesn’t meet the condition.\n\nUse error, warning or success validation messages according to the validation scenario.\n\nUse error messaging when the person can’t proceed without fixing their input, and use a warning message when the input can be used, but may not be expected. For example, when capturing a date of birth, show a warning message if it would indicate the person being unreasonably old, such as with 01/01/1880.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig10}\n    imageAlt=\"A date input showing the successful validation of an input.\"\n    caption=\"Use success validation when checking input against limited availability.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={fig11}\n    imageAlt=\"A date input correctly displaying an invalid entry errored state.\"\n    caption=\"Use the correct validation message with each validation state.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n",

The top section is managed left to right, through month and year selectors. The middle section contains the calendar view or month / year list, with focus depending on navigation method used. The bottom section contains the ‘go to today’ and ‘clear’ buttons, with focus managed left to right.\n\nThe date picker should act as a focus trap so the user only cycles through the date picker dropdown when the date picker is open.\n\nUse the clear icon in a [date input](/components/date-input) or clear button in a date picker to clear an input.\n\nThe date picker can be navigated with keyboard only input.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nWhen moving to a date selection, screen readers will announce in the format “Monday 06 October 2023”.\n\nWhen focussing the date picker calendar dates, screen readers will announce the date as weekday, date, month and year sequentially, for example “Choose Wednesday, 8 November 2023”.\n\nWhen focus is trapped in the date picker dropdown screen, reader should announce route to exit focus. For example, “ic-date-picker, 03 July 2024, press ESC to exit”.\n\nThe date picker will only open when users select the date picker icon from within date input.\n\n## Based on\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/ \"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, World Wide Web Consortium\n    </ic-link>\n    , published 24 July 2023, accessed August 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-datepicker/ \"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, World Wide Web Consortium\n    </ic-link>\n    , published 05 June 2018, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/date-input/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Date picker UX design guidelines, Nielson Norman Group\n    </ic-link>\n    , published 22 January 2017.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.aditus.io/patterns/accordion/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, World Wide Web Consortium\n    </ic-link>\n    , published 20 June 2023, accessed February 2024.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

For example, if there is a need to see which day of the week a future event occurs.\n\n## When not to use\n\nAvoid using a date picker for well-known dates, such as dates of birth, because it is often easier to type this into a field. For example, if selecting 30/07/1966, consider using [date input](/components/date-input) as a date picker would require many clicks to arrive at the same date.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={figure2}\n    imageAlt=\"A date picker being used to select a very distant date\"\n    caption=\"Avoid using a date picker when dealing with distant dates.\"\n    state=\"caution\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Sizing\n\nUse the date picker size properties to change its vertical size and achieve compact or spacious layouts.\n\n### Width\n\nUse the resizing options to increase or decrease width to match other elements in a form.\n\nUse the [date input](/components/date-input) resizing options to change size of the input and calendar between minimum and maximum widths. For example, to create a larger date picker, resize width of [date input](/components/date-input).\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={figure3}\n  imageAlt=\"Two date picker examples at their maximum and minimum width\"\n  caption=\"Change the width of the date input to adjust the date picker width.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n/>\n\n## Content\n\n### Labels\n\nUse [content styling](/styles/content-style/principles) for help with building effective labels for people using date input.\n\n### Helper text\n\nUse helper text to indicate restrictions in your date input such as not allowing weekends.\n\n### Placeholder\n\nUse a placeholder to demonstrate an example of the desired input. Do not add essential information into the placeholder as it will be hidden when a date is entered into the field.\n\n## Interaction\n\nSet `open-at-date` to specify the date in view when the date picker is opened. If no date is set, the date picker will default to showing the current date.\n\nThe [date input](/components/date-input) and the date picker update according to any input made. For example, if 10/10/2100 is entered in the [date input](/components/date-input), the date picker will open to display the selection.\n\n## Validation\n\nSee [date input](/components/date-input#validation) for detailed guidance on how to display errors within the date picker.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={figure4}\n  imageAlt=\"A date picker with error caused by choosing a date outside of allowed range.\"\n  caption=\"Make sure to be clear and instructive when writing error messages.

Often, 'cancel' buttons are included in the interaction area at the bottom of the modal. These provide a specific decision to cancel the task, as opposed to simply closing the modal.\n\nWhen a dialog is open, the page in the background is effectively disabled. It cannot be scrolled and focus cannot be moved to any element on it. This is so that the user's attention is constrained to the content of the dialog until they choose an action to continue.\n\nFor dialogs that contain a primary action, focus is automatically applied to the primary action button when opened. This is so that it is easy to perform the main call-to-action if included.\n\nHowever, if a destructive action button is used, then focus is automatically applied to the dismiss button, as accidentally triggering the destructive action could be problematic. It also emphasises the user decision to choose to continue with the destructive action.\n\nIf a dialog contains interactive elements such as inputs or selection methods, then focus is automatically applied to the first interaction element in the body section. This follows a logical tab order when completing a task in a dialog.\n\nWhen a dialog is closed, focus returns to the element that triggered the dialog in the first place. This helps the user pick up where they left off.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nDialogs resize to become full-screen on smaller devices to make use of all of the available screen space. This is especially useful when text is resized or the browser window is zoomed.\n\nDialogs always appear centred so that a consistent location is used to find them. This can be helpful to users of screen magnifiers as the position of dialogs is consistent and therefore easier to find if displayed outside of the magnified area.\n\nDialogs are announced by screen readers when displayed and their content can be navigated through using the virtual cursor.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe dialog component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2023/01/26/use-the-dialog-element.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Use the dialog element (reasonably)\n    </ic-link>\n    , Scott O'Hara, published 26th January 2023, accessed February 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/accessible-dialog-from-scratch/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Creating An Accessible Dialog From Scratch\n    </ic-link>\n    , Kitty Giraudel, published 28th July 2021, accessed February 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Modal & Nonmodal Dialogs: When (& When Not) to Use Them\n    </ic-link>\n    , Therese Fessenden, NNg, published April 23rd 2017, accessed February 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/10/dialog-focus-in-screen-readers.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Dialog Focus in Screen Readers\n    </ic-link>\n    , Adrian Roselli, updated 26th January 2023, accessed February 2023.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Dialogs appear modally, meaning that the user must take action to acknowledge the dialog before continuing.\r\n\r\nDialogs work best when used for short tasks or to alert the user to information relevant for their current task. A dialog appears on top of the main page content and is persistent until dismissed.\r\n\r\n## Component demo\r\n\r\nexport const DialogExample = () => {\r\n  const dialogEl = useRef(null);\r\n  const showDialog = () => {\r\n    dialogEl.current.open = true;\r\n  };\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <IcButton onclick={showDialog} aria-label=\"Launch dialog\">\r\n        Launch dialog\r\n      </IcButton>\r\n      <IcDialog heading=\"Are you sure?\" label=\"Coffee order\" ref={dialogEl}>\r\n        <IcTypography>\r\n          You are about to add 'Americano' to your basket.

The dialog has a checkbox in its content that allows the user to signify agreement. There are two buttons for 'continue' and 'go back'.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use dialogs with interactive content in the content area to capture key input from a user before continuing.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse dialogs to show additional information that can be opened from the underlying page. These dialogs can be passive and contain no actions other than a dismiss button to close the dialog.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dialogFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\": An example dialog containing additional information about the 'Americano' product.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use dialogs to provide additional information that isn't displayed on the underlying page.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAdd a status [alert](/components/alert) to a dialog to provide additional meaning in relation to a specific status. These can include any alert status variant.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dialogFig4}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example dialog for a coffee order asking if the user is sure they want to continue adding the product 'Americano' to their basket. It contains a warning alert that says 'Only a few left'.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use a status alert within a dialog to highlight important information related to the dialog's content.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse dialogs when a destructive action is about to take place. Ask the user to confirm if they want to continue to conduct the action and provide a way of cancelling the action.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dialogFig5}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example dialog for removing an item from a basket. It provides a destructive action button for 'Remove' and a secondary button for 'Go back'.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use a dialog for destructive actions to give the user an option to back out at the last minute.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nAvoid using dialogs to contain complicated tasks or processes. Instead consider if such complex tasks could be placed on a page themselves.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dialogFig6}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example dialog containing a multi-step form for selecting and adding drinks to an order. A stepper with four steps is used with multiple form elements inside each step.\"\r\n  state=\"caution\"\r\n  caption=\"Whilst you can put any content within a dialog, avoid placing complex tasks in one and consider placing it on the main page itself.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nDon't place important information inside a dialog if it is not part of the main flow of task. Such information can be missed so consider placing it on the page itself. Avoid repeating information in a dialog that is displayed on the page itself.\r\n\r\nDon't use dialogs when information from the main page content is required to complete a task within a dialog. Keep all information required to complete the task in a dialog within the dialog. If more information is required, consider if dialogs may not be suitable for the task.\r\n\r\nAvoid overusing dialogs to bring every decision in a task to the user's attention. Use dialogs for the key actions in a task instead. Dialogs may be ignored if used too frequently.\r\n\r\nOnly show dialogs after a user action has triggered it, and make sure its content is contextual to the user action. Don't show dialogs if a user has not performed a specific action on the page.\r\n\r\n## Interaction behaviour\r\n\r\nDisplay dialogs after users complete a specific action on a page such as clicking a 'submit' button.\r\n\r\nAlways make sure the dismiss button is included within a dialog, and select whether to allow the dialog to close by clicking on the background scrim.\r\n\r\nWhen a dialog is displayed, the page content in the background cannot be interacted with.\r\n\r\nContent can scroll within the body of a dialog, whilst the header section and interaction section are sticky at the top and bottom of the dialog window.\r\n\r\n## Sizing\r\n\r\nSet the dialog's size dependent on the amount of content that is being displayed in it. Large dialogs take up most of the screen so are good to use when there is a lot of content to display such as a table. Small dialogs only use a small amount of the screen so are best used for short additional information.\r\n\r\nOn extra small breakpoints all dialogs automatically change to their full-screen setting to provide maximum space for their content.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nAlways give dialogs a meaningful heading and describe the task that the dialog contains.\r\n\r\nAdd an optional label to a dialog to add categorisation or other secondary information.\r\n\r\nSpecify any content within the dialog's body section, but take care not to place too much information in a dialog if it is best placed as a page itself. Also, consider using a full page instead of a dialog when lots of interactive elements are required.\r\n\r\nAlways follow the [content style](/styles/content-style) when writing textual content.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dialogFig7}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A diagram showing the anatomy of a dialog. It has three areas, a title area at the top, a content area in the middle, and an action area at the bottom.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Dialogs have three sections: a title area, a content area and an action area.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhen adding interactive content to a dialog and it has popover elements, to avoid the elements being cut off within the content area, use the prop `disableHeightConstraint` to allow the dialog to stretch to contain its content.\r\n",

They make it easier for people to understand and navigate the interface.\r\n\r\n<ComponentPreview>\r\n  <div\r\n    style={{\r\n      display: \"flex\",\r\n      flexDirection: \"column\",\r\n      gap: \"var(--ic-space-md)\",\r\n      width: \"100%\",\r\n    }}\r\n  >\r\n    <IcDivider />\r\n    <IcDivider borderStyle=\"dashed\" />\r\n    <IcDivider label=\"Coffee options\" labelPlacement=\"center\" />\r\n  </div>\r\n</ComponentPreview>\r\n\r\nColour, white space, images, lines, and shadows are all great examples of visual dividers. An example of a functional divider is 'full-width' which uses the entire length of a layout, whilst 'inset' dividers align with the leading edge of the screen.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig1}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Full-width dividers being used to group a person's messages.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Add full-width dividers to help group content.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig2}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An inset divider used to clearly separate the description of a mug and the list of the colours in which it is available.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Add inset dividers to help group content.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n## Component variants\r\n\r\nThere are five types of variants which display dividers in diverse ways.\r\n\r\n### Border style\r\n\r\nUse a default divider for a simple way to group content. For a decorative approach, use the dashed divider.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dividerFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Light, dashed divider with 4px weight used to define sections of a web page.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use a dashed divider to make the page feel more textured.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Appearance\r\n\r\nUse the divider's theme and monochrome options to change the colour so that it complements the rest of your app's colour scheme. Use the theme options to set the colour of the divider to its light or dark theme colour. Use the monochrome option to set the divider to a grey colour.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Full-width dividers in the 'dark' theme colour.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"The 'dark' theme colour on the divider component.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig5}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Full-width dividers in the 'light' theme colour.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"The 'light' theme colour on the divider component.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n### Weight\r\n\r\nThe divider component has four weights to choose from. These are thin, medium, thick and very thick.\r\n\r\nAlter the weight of the divider to create a clear and logical structure of the page; for example, using a thicker divider to clearly separate unrelated content, whilst using thinner dividers to group together less important content.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dividerFig6}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Divider in 'light' theme colour and 8px weight used to separate two sections of a page, whilst various monochrome dividers with 1px weight separate less important content.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use different weights of dividers to show the structure of a page.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Label and orientation\r\n\r\nPair dividers with labels to help define content groupings. Place the label within the divider to reinforce the label's connection to the content below the divider.\r\n\r\nFor the horizontal divider, the alignment of the label can be left-aligned, centred, or right-aligned. For the vertical divider, the label can also be centred, or placed at the top or bottom of the divider.\r\n\r\nMake sure the text in the label is brief so that it clearly aids navigation and page structure. If not, the divider component becomes overwhelming. When the text reaches a certain amount, it will go onto multiple lines which disregards the divider's purpose. The information placed here should be non-essential with textual content placed inside the page content itself.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig7}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Divider with left-aligned 'Advanced' label being used to separate sections in Settings.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Divider being placed to the right of the label to reinforce the label's connection to the content.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig8}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Divider with left-aligned label that has a word count which is not recommended. Multiple lines are required to show the lengthy label.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Divider with label text that is too long.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nUse horizontal or vertical dividers to create any necessary sections between content. Pair the vertical divider with text to create a title when you want to draw attention to a paragraph.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={dividerFig9}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Vertical dividers used to create sections of related content.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use the vertical divider to create sections of related content.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## When to use\r\n\r\nUse dividers when you want to group a similar type of content together and create a visual hierarchy between the content.\r\n\r\nFor example, apply dividers between sections of content to make groups and create the appearance of containers. Try to avoid mixing the different divider variants to ensure a smooth design.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig10}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An inset divider used to break up alphabetical sections.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use dividers when you want to group a similar type of content together.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nDo not use dividers to separate individual items when it is not necessary. Use dividers to group items instead.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={dividerFig11}\r\n    imageAlt=\"Inset dividers being used to separate individual contacts rather than separating by alphabetical sections.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Do not use dividers to separate individual items when it is not necessary.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nIt is important not to over-use dividers. This is because you can often achieve the same effect with a change in background colour or sensible margins.\r\n\r\n## Hierarchy\r\n\r\nDefault dividers may be used to separate main sections of content, whereas monochrome, small-sized or even dashed dividers may be better suited to separating lists of elements.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility considerations\r\n\r\nAs dividers are commonly a decorative element, they do not need to obey the same colour contrast rules as text or other interface components. Consider setting the divider's appearance so that it blends nicely with the rest of your application.\r\n",

They allow actions to be provided so that people can continue their tasks and understand that something might be missing.\n\nThe empty state component’s text elements provide a way of clearly indicating what the problem is, why it happened, and what action is best to perform next.\n\nInteractive elements within the empty state follow a logical tabbing order.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nEmpty state components should be announced by a screen reader if they appear due to another user action on a page. They may constitute a status change on the page so should be announced by a screen region after the change has occurred.\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. It’s been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.\n",

Use them to engage people and guide them on what is best to do next by including a button or a link to the next best action.\r\n\r\nEmpty states are used for many different reasons such as:\r\n\r\n- No content yet exists due to the first-time use of the functionality.\r\n- Data was not successfully loaded.\r\n- A query or search term yielded no results.\r\n- Data was removed resulting in nothing remaining to display.\r\n\r\nUse empty states when no data can be displayed in a component’s contents. For example, show an empty state when no data is available to display in a data table, or if a search term didn’t find any results.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app called ‘We love coffee’ with a page displaying favourite teas. An empty data table is displayed with an empty state that reads ‘There’s nothing here’.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use empty states when there is no data available to display.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse empty states to highlight access issues. If a user does not have access to some content, use an empty state to provide this messaging as well as a means of continuing.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig2}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app showing favourite coffees. The ‘americano’ product is selected, but show’s a ‘locked’ status on it. A drawer is displayed containing an empty state component that reads ‘Sorry, you don’t have access to this at the moment’.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use empty states to show access rights issue if the content is not available to that user.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nEmpty states are not always due to errors, so use positive messaging as well. For example, in a to-do list app, all items might have been cleared and so the empty state message may be celebratory.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app that shows new orders for coffee that need to be fulfilled. After the orders have been completed, an empty state component is displayed showing a positive message that reads ‘All done! Have a cuppa’.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use empty states for positive messaging when empty is the desirable state, such as in a ticketing system or to-do list.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse empty states as starting points for processes that require people to add input into an app. For example, a calendar entry may have no events yet, so use an empty state to prompt for an event to be added.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={emptyStateFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example app showing a product customisation page for an Americano coffee. A section appears titled ‘Extras’ and an empty state message is displayed prompting the user to ‘add extras’.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use the empty state component as a starting point for a process, such as adding extras to a product customisation.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nAvoid using custom components instead of empty states. The empty state component creates an easily understandable, consistent method of indicating that no data is available and therefore what to do next.\r\n\r\nDon’t use empty states to communicate other messages to people that are not related to something being empty, use [alerts](/components/alert) or [toasts](/components/toasts) instead. Only use empty states in situations where no data is present to display.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig5}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A blog post titled ‘The perfect blend’. An empty state component is used inline with the content that reads ‘This is a brand new post’.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don’t use empty states to convey messages that are not related to an empty state.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nDon’t use empty states to show error messages that could otherwise be displayed using other [form validation](/patterns/form-validation) patterns. Only use empty states to show errors relating to data not being loaded successfully.\r\n\r\nDon’t use empty states to indicate something is loading, instead use a [loading indicator](/components/loading-indicator).\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={emptyStateFig6}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An empty state component being used to indicate that an order history is loading.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Don’t use empty state components for loading messages.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n## Sizing\r\n\r\nEmbed empty states in components that would otherwise show data. For example, use them in containers, cards, dialogs or data tables.\r\n\r\nUse an empty state on a full screen in case something couldn’t be loaded, or there is no content available yet. For example, use an empty state to show a 404 message.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig7}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An empty state component displayed on a full screen that reads ‘There’s nothing here.’\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Use empty states on full screen page if no data is available to display.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig8}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app with a side panel displayed over the page content containing an empty state component that reads ‘No comments yet’.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Use empty states in other containers such as drawers and side panels.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig9}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A grid of cards for coffee products with one card showing an empty state component that reads ‘Woops, this coffee cup is empty’.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Use empty states within other components and containers when no data is present.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\nSet the alignment of the empty state to match the component or container it sits in.\r\n\r\nPlace empty states at the top and don’t resize the container, keep it sized the same as if the primary content was displayed instead.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nUse the empty state to clearly communicate to someone what has happened, why they are seeing the empty state and what to do next.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig10}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A diagram showing the different elements that make up the empty state component. These are an image or icon, a title, a subtitle, some body text, and an interaction area.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"The empty state component has an image or icon, a title, a subtitle, some body text and an interaction area.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAdd an illustration, image or icon to an empty state to provide additional recognition or reinforce the written message.\r\n\r\nUse the empty state heading to clearly indicate the state of the empty content.\r\n\r\nUse the subheading to add more detail and explain why this may have happened.\r\n\r\nUse the body to explain how to rectify the issue, or to explain what is best to do next.\r\n\r\nUse the interaction area to include actions and links that will help people to continue through the app. Always include either a primary button or a navigation link, and occasionally include a secondary button or link if other routes are possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, avoid placing too many actions in the interaction area as this will cause confusion about what to do next.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={emptyStateFig11}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An empty state component that has three buttons and three links within its interaction area.\"\r\n  state=\"caution\"\r\n  caption=\"Avoid placing too many actions within the interaction area.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nDon’t place other interactive components, such as inputs, in an empty state’s interaction area. If input needs to be collected, then do this on a full page or on a dialog.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution imageSrc={emptyStateFig12} imageAlt=\"\" state=\"bad\" caption=\"\" />\r\n\r\n## Accessibility considerations\r\n\r\nIf an empty state is displayed as a result of a change on a page, make sure it is announced by a screen reader using a live region.\r\n\r\n## Related components\r\n\r\n- [Alert](/components/alert).\r\n- [Loading indicator](/components/loading-indicator).\r\n",

The alt-text should simply be the name of the organisation or entity that the logo describes.\n\nThe footer uses the HTML footer page region to allow quick navigation between page regions when using assistive technology.

These are single line footers and grouped footers.\r\n\r\nUse a footer on every page so that the required legal information is displayed.\r\n\r\n### Single line\r\n\r\nUse single line footers when eight or fewer links are required and there is no need to split those links into groups.\r\n\r\n### Grouped\r\n\r\nUse grouped footers when more than eight links are required or the links can be grouped meaningfully.\r\n\r\n## Colour\r\n\r\nThe background colour of the footer reflects the chosen brand colour for the application. Set the global brand colour token to change the footer’s appearance.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer using automatically generated secondary and tertiary shades of the app’s brand colour as the background colours for the footer’s link section and logo section respectively.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Change the global brand colour token to change the footer’s appearance.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Sizing\r\n\r\nThe footer always extends to the full width of the viewport.\r\n\r\nDon’t embed the footer within another container that is not full width.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig2}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer positioned centred between two other content areas that sit to the left and right of the footer.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don’t place the footer within other content. Always make sure it's the full width of the viewport.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\n### Placement\r\n\r\nAlways place the footer at the bottom of the page and below the fold, meaning users should scroll to see it.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer component placed below the fold within a page design.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Footer placed correctly below the fold on a page.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig4}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer component placed above the fold within a page design.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Footer placed incorrectly above the fold.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nPosition the footer adjacent to the [side navigation](/components/side-navigation) if your app uses one.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig5}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app showing a side navigation component with a footer component positioned on the right and adjacent to the side navigation.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Place the footer adjacent to the side navigation.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Alignment\r\n\r\nThe footer can be set to left-aligned, centred or full width.\r\n\r\nUse left-aligned to align footer content to the left of the main body of the page. This works well with apps that use the side navigation.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig6}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer component with its content left aligned.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"A footer with its content left aligned.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse centred alignment to centre footer content to the main body of the page.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig7}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer component with its content centre aligned.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"A footer with its content centre aligned.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse full-width to position footer content so that it spans the full width of the viewport.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig8}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer component with its content aligned to the full width of the viewport.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"A footer with its content aligned to the full width of the viewport.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nFooters provide a set of links that can be accessed from every page within an app. Specify either single links or grouped links when using a footer.\r\n\r\nGive link groups clear labels when using grouped links.\r\n\r\nOrder the links so that the most important links appear at the top left of the links section.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig9}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer showing a single set of links.

The logos appear at the bottom of the footer. Choose the correct theme (i.e., light or dark) of your logo to match the selected brand colour background.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={footerFig11}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A footer displaying four different logos on a large screen.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"A footer displaying four different logos on a large screen.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nProvide additional information in either the top section above the links or in the bottom section below the logos.

Where these components are interactive, then their normal focus behaviour is used.\n\nThe hero's content is ordered for focus in the following way:\n\n- Title section including any subtitles\n- Interaction area\n- Right-hand section\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={heroFig17}\n  imageAlt=\"A diagram of the hero banners main sections.

Use the hero to catch a user's attention as it's often the first thing that they see.\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nDon't use hero banners part way through page content to introduce sections. They should always appear at the top of the page to act as an introduction to the full page.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={heroFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example application with some content at the top of the page, then a hero banner introducing a section, and then more content.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don't position hero banners part way through a page. Always position them at the top of page content.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Colour\r\n\r\nHero banners use an automatic secondary variant of an app's chosen theme colour.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={heroFig2}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A hero banner with background colours based of the selected green theme colour.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Hero banners automatically set their colour based on the selected theme colour.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={heroFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\"A hero banner with a grey background colour and black text.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Set the hero background colour to grey when colour is not appropriate.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Sizing\r\n\r\nUse default sized hero for most applications.

This may be ordered either alphabetically, or in order of appearance. Make sure to label links with relevant information at the beginning of the string of text. For example, don’t embed “How to contact us”, but rather “Contact us”.\r\n",

Loading indicators should not flash, as this can be problematic for users with particular accessibility needs.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nLoading indicators use the `aria-live` attribute to tell screen reader users that there is dynamic content on the page. `aria-busy` tells assistive tech that the container is getting new content. `aria-busy` will be false when the container isn't refreshing and will be equal to true when the content is reloading.\n\n`aria-live` takes three attributes: `off`, `polite` and `assertive`. While polite doesn’t interrupt the screen reader if other content is being read, assertive will immediately read out the element’s content. Loading indicators use assertive to ensure screen reader users are provided with the same information as other users.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe loading indicator component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://dockyard.com/blog/2020/03/02/accessible-loading-indicatorswith-no-extra-elements\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessible Loading Indicators—with No Extra Elements!\n    </ic-link>\n    , James Steinbach, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/loading/accessibility/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Loading: Accessibility\n    </ic-link>\n    , IBM, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Buttons are triggered using either the ‘enter’ or ‘space’ key.\n\nThe current page is always displayed in the component so that the user knows where in the data set they are.\n\nWhen the user is at the start or end of the data, the navigation buttons are disabled so that it is clear there is no more data past that point.\n\nUsing the items per page selector in the pagination bar allows users to control how much information is available per page. This can help to either simplify complex pages or to increase the information density.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nEach pagination component uses accessible names for buttons that lack meaning in the context of a screen reader. Page buttons that simply have their page number as the visible label are given an accessible label of ‘Go to page X’ so that it is clearer what their function is.\n\nThe term ‘page X’ can be overridden in the case that it is not accurate. For example, this can be changed to read ‘sheet X’, ‘set X’, ‘slide X’ instead if it is a better representation.\n\nSimilarly, the icon buttons used for next, previous, first and last are also given accessible name so that their action is clearer when announced by a screen reader.\n\nThe pagination components use the nav element so that they become navigational landmarks on a page and can therefore be swiftly navigated to by users of assistive technology.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe pagination component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.a11ymatters.com/pattern/pagination/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessible Pagination\n    </ic-link>\n    , Accessibility Matters, published October 2016, accessed March 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/27/using-navigation-landmarks/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Using navigation landmarks\n    </ic-link>\n    , Accessibility in government, published May 2016, accessed March 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://uxplanet.org/ux-infinite-scrolling-vs-pagination-1030d29376f1\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      UX: Infinite scrolling vs. Pagination\n    </ic-link>\n    , Nick Babich, published May 2016, accessed March 2023.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Displays the current page as a label.\r\n\r\nUse the pagination components within a pagination bar to provide other navigation controls including:\r\n\r\n- Items per page selector: Switch the number of content items visible per page.\r\n- Item count: Display the range of currently visible items as well as the total number of items.\r\n- Go to page shortcut: Allow quick access to any page number by typing the page number and hitting ‘go’.\r\n\r\n## When to use\r\n\r\nUse pagination when you have a large, known amount of content that can be split across pages. Order the content so the most relevant appears on the first page. Pagination works best for lists of content such as search results and data items.\r\n\r\nTry to create an understandable order to the content split across pages. This way it is easier to understand what content might appear on a later page.\r\n\r\nFor example, if content is ordered alphabetically, then it becomes obvious that entries beginning with a ‘Z’ would appear on the last few pages.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={paginationFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example application showing a list of hot drink products split across pages. A pagination component provides access to navigate through the list of products.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use pagination to split content across multiple pages.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse pagination for content when there are other elements on the page that can be scrolled to. This means all elements on the page can easily be navigated to without scrolling through a large amount of content.\r\n\r\nPagination provides full control over the content; it allows navigation to any page of content quickly and gives an indication of the total amount of content available.\r\n\r\nUse complex pagination to allow people to easily navigate between pages without having to move sequentially through content. This allows people to quickly skip around between pages to search for specific content.\r\n\r\nUse simple pagination to navigate sequentially between pages using the ‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={paginationFig2}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An image showing two pagination components. Complex pagination provides numbered buttons for each page. Simple pagination simply provides next, previous, first and last buttons.\"\r\n    state=\"none\"\r\n    caption=\"Use complex or simple pagination variants for different implementations.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nUse a pagination bar to provide more navigation functionality through particularly complex data sets. For example, use pagination bars with data tables to navigate large data sets easily.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={paginationFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example nutritional data table for coffee products. Coffee products are displayed in a table and a pagination bar allows the number of items per page to be changed, displays the total number of items, and includes a simple pagination control allowing navigation through the pages.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use a pagination bar to provide more functionality.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nAvoid using pagination to split up linear content such as articles or blogs. Scrolling down the page makes it easier to consume this content.\r\n\r\nAvoid using pagination when the size of the content is unknown or if it frequently changes. This causes the number of pages to change frequently and means it is hard to create a ‘last page’ option.\r\n\r\nUse an infinite scrolling pattern when navigating content should be explorative, or when there is a near infinite amount of content. For example, newsfeeds and comments threads can be near endless and infinite scrolling allows exploration by simply continuing to scroll.\r\n\r\nAvoid using simple pagination when it is important to be able to move between specific pages; complex pagination is better for this as it shows more adjacent pages, allowing one click navigation.\r\n\r\n## Interaction behaviour\r\n\r\nPagination components fire an event when a new page is selected. Use this to trigger the switch of pages in the app.\r\n\r\nIn a pagination bar, when the number of items per page is changed, then the pagination component and the item count updates to show the new number of pages. Make sure to update the pagination component if anything else on the page changes the number of pages. For example, setting a filter may reduce the number of pages required to display the filtered results.\r\n\r\n## Colour\r\n\r\nUse the default, dark and light theme pagination with `monochrome={true}` when placing them on different coloured backgrounds to ensure the correct contrast ratios are met.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={paginationFig4}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Three pagination examples on different coloured backgrounds. The default theme pagination is used on a white background. The monochrome dark theme pagination is used on a light yellow background. The monochrome light theme pagination is used on a dark grey background.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Use colour contrast variants when placing pagination components on different coloured backgrounds.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\nPlace the pagination component so that it is obvious what it controls. Match the width of a pagination bar to the width of the page.\r\n\r\nTry to place pagination at the bottom of the page it controls, as this encourages the user to read through the page before moving to the next. However, placing pagination at the top of the page is still a valid option.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={paginationFig5}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example product grid showing hot beverages. A pagination control appears below the drinks grid that it controls.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Try to place pagination at the bottom of the container it controls.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nFor large page containers that require scrolling, use two pagination components at the top and bottom of the page container to provide easy access to navigation when at either the top or bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={paginationFig6}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example product grid showing hot beverages. A complex pagination control appears below the drinks grid that it controls. A simple pagination control is displayed in the top-right above the product grid.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Place pagination controls at the top and bottom of the page container to provide additional navigation functionality.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nWhen using complex pagination, specify the number of adjacent pages to display next to the current page. Also specify the number of boundary pages to display at the start and end of the page range.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={paginationFig7}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Three complex pagination components with different settings for adjacent and boundary items. Increasing boundary items shows more page buttons at the start and end of the range. Increasing the adjacent items shows more page buttons next to the current page.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Set the adjacent and boundary items to change which page buttons are displayed.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSelect which elements within a pagination bar you want to display. Each element in the pagination bar can be toggled on or off except for the pagination component itself, which can be switched to use complex or simple pagination.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={paginationFig8}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Three example pagination bars with different elements displaying. The top shows the ‘items per page selector’ and ‘go to page button’ displayed, whilst the other examples have these elements hidden.\"\r\n  state=\"none\"\r\n  caption=\"Select which elements to show within a pagination bar.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nBy default, pages are referred to as pages in the pagination component. Override the pagination label to change this. For example, change the term pages to ‘sheets’ if it makes more sense for a data table implementation.\r\n",

This enables the menu to be opened using usual keyboard commands. Clicking on a menu item closes the menu after triggering the menu item's action. A menu item's action can also be triggered using the 'Space' and 'Enter' keys. Popover menu groups use the role ‘group’.\n\nPopover menus appear overlaid on other content. When opening a sub-menu, focus is applied to the whole sub-menu and then the items are navigated between using the up and down arrow keys. When focus is moved on, the popover menu closes automatically. Using the ‘Esc’ key will also close the popover menu.\n\nDisabled menu items can still be focussed upon so that the structure of the menu is understandable, even if the menu item can’t be triggered at that time.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nEach menu item within a popover menu can use an aria-label that provides additional context that may not be required in a visible label.\n\nFor ease of use, actions can be assigned keyboard shortcuts and these are displayed on the menu item. This information is announced by a screen reader when each menu item is focussed.\n\nWhen moving between sub-menus in a popover menu, the nested sub-menu’s level is announced by a screen reader so that it is easy to understand whereabouts you are within the menu structure.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe popover menu component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/group_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Aria Group Role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN Web Docs, accessed 22nd March 2023\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/accessibility/aria/roles/menu_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Aria Menu Role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN Web Docs, accessed 22nd March 2023\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/menuitem_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Aria Menuitem Role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN Web Docs, accessed 22nd March 2023\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Aria Menuitemcheckbox Role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN Web Docs, accessed 22nd March 2023\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

This is especially useful when there is not enough space to include all actions on the base page. Popover menus are commonly used for ‘More actions’ and often triggered using an icon button.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={popoverFig1}\n    imageAlt=\"A popover menu with edit and view options using a mix of menu items, menu groups and menu toggle items.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use popover menus to contain multiple actions.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## When not to use\n\nDon’t use a popover menu if there are only a small number of actions. Consider if the actions can be better placed on the page itself.\n\nAvoid placing important actions in popover menus as these may be missed. Instead, use popover menus to house secondary or less important actions and place your most important actions on the page itself.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={popoverFig2}\n    imageAlt=\"A popover menu with two options for edit and download. Plenty of space is available on the background interface to display these options.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Avoid using popover menus with few actions, or with important actions.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nDon’t include any other content within a popover menu other than the elements described in this page. If additional information is required about an action, consider using a [dialog](/components/dialog) instead.\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nWhen you click a trigger element, a popover menu appears. Make sure to associate the popover menu with a trigger and ensure that the trigger can be actioned via any input mode.\n\nWhen you click a menu item within a popover menu, the popover menu will hide and the menu item’s associated action will be triggered.\n\n<video\n  class=\"half-width\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"An animation showing a popover menu that appears after clicking a ‘more’ button. The menu is closed when a menu item is clicked.\"\n>\n  <source src={popoverVid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n### Sizing\n\nBy default, popover menus expand vertically to hug their contents. Set a max-height on the popover menu to constrain the height and allow the menu to scroll. Avoid setting the width of the popover menu to be greater than the available viewport.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={popoverFig3}\n  imageAlt=\"Two examples of popover menus. The first displays all menu items within the menu container. The second example shows the same menu items, but with some hidden due to a smaller menu container. A scroll bar allows the menu to be scrolled.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Set a max-height to constrain the height of the menu and cause its contents to scroll.\"\n/>\n\n### Layout and placement\n\nPopover menus appear adjacent to their triggering element. By default, they appear below and aligned to the left of the trigger element. However, if no space is available, the popover menu will appear above or aligned to the right of the trigger element.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={popoverFig4}\n  imageAlt=\"Two examples of popover menus. The first example shows the menu aligned to the left of the screen. The second shows the menu aligned to the right.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Popover menus position themselves based on the available space.\"\n/>\n\n## Content\n\nPopover menus contain menu items, menu toggle items, menu groups and menu sections.\n\n### Labels\n\nFollow the [content style](/styles/content-style) guidelines when writing labels and keep them concise but specific.\n\nAlways specify an accessible label for the menu items. The accessible label can include more detail than is described in the visible label.\n\nFor example, a menu item may have a visible label that reads ‘Edit’. The accessible label may read ‘Edit record’. This includes more information to aid assistive technology users.\n\n### Icons\n\nUse an icon on a menu item to provide additional meaning or to aid in recognition. Menu items, menu toggle items and parent menu items can display an icon.\n\nMake sure that the icon is understandable and relevant to the action.\n\nAlways provide alternative descriptions for icons if they aren't decorative. Only use icons if they are necessary.\n\n### Menu items\n\nUse the 'default' variant of menu items for single actions that do not have a selection status.\n\nAdd an additional description to a menu item to provide additional context. Keep the description concise and consider if the action is too complicated if too much information is required to describe the action.\n\nIf a keyboard shortcut is available for a menu item’s action, then display it using the keyboard shortcut label.\n\nUse the 'destructive' variant of a menu item to highlight a destructive action. Position destructive actions at the bottom of a popover menu.\n\nSpecify a menu item as a parent if it has children that appear in a sub-menu. When clicked, the sub-menu will slide into view.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={popoverFig5}\n    imageAlt=\"A popover menu showing a set of edit options that include icons and keyboard shortcuts alongside their labels.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use menu items for single actions. Add an icon or a description to provide more context. Highlight keyboard shortcuts using the keyboard shortcut label.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Menu toggle items\n\nUse the 'toggle' variant of menu items for actions that provide an ability to toggle something on or off. Menu toggle items will display a checkmark when toggled on and hide it when toggled off.\n\nLike default menu items, provide an icon or a description to add additional context if required.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={popoverFig6}\n    imageAlt=\"A popover menu containing two menu toggle items. Their labels read ‘Show/Hide’ and ‘Lock/Unlock’ and display a tick indicating that they are toggled on.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use menu toggle items to show a selection state alongside the action.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Menu groups\n\nUse menu groups to organise menu items into sections within the popover menu. Provide a label for the menu group to describe its contents. Alternatively, leave the menu group label blank if a description is unnecessary.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={popoverFig7}\n    imageAlt=\" A popover menu with a menu group for ‘Edit options’, a menu group for ‘View options’, an untitled menu group containing unrelated actions, and a final untitled menu group containing destructive actions.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use menu groups to create sections within a popover menu.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Parent menu items\n\nUse a parent menu item to open sub-menus that include more menu items. Use this to contain similar actions or options relating to the menu group name.\n\n<video\n  class=\"half-width\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"An animation showing a popover menu with a parent menu item titled ‘Zoom’. A sub-menu containing menu items for different zoom levels is opened after the ‘zoom’ parent menu item is clicked. After the back button is clicked in the sub-menu the main menu is displayed again.\"\n>\n  <source src={popoverVid2} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n### Sub-menus\n\nUse a sub-menu to contain a parent menu item’s children items. Use sub-menus for multiple related actions that are opened from the main menu.\n\nThe sub-menu displays the same label as the parent menu item. Clicking the back button in a sub-menu will return the user to the parent menu item in the main menu.\n\nUse menu items, toggle menu items, menu groups or parent menu items in a sub-menu but avoid nesting too many levels of sub-menus as this can be confusing to navigate.\n\n<video\n  class=\"half-width\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"An animation showing a popover menu that contains four parent menu items each with nested parent menu items in their sub-menus. The user clicks ‘help options’ to go into the sub-menu, then clicks ‘information’ to go into a second sub-menu, then clicks ‘tutorials’ to go into a third sub-menu.\"\n>\n  <source src={popoverVid3} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen specifying the trigger element for a popover menu, make use of ‘aria-expanded’ and ‘aria-collapsed’ so that a screen reader announces the appearance of the popover menu.\n",

Once focus is on the radio group, the **arrow** keys move between the radio options. When tabbing to a radio group with an option already selected, the focus is applied to the selected option. Moving through the other radio options using the arrow keys automatically selects the focused option.\n\nWhen tabbing to a radio group with no option selected, the focus is applied to the first option in the group without selecting the option. The unselected radio button can be selected using the **space** key when the radio button is focused.\n\nWhen conditional fields are displayed beneath radio buttons, the conditional field acts as the child of the radio button. When the field is dynamically displayed after selecting a radio button, then it should be announced by the screen reader as required based on the user’s current selection. Tabbing on from the radio group should move focus to the dynamically displayed field, and then onwards through the rest of the tab index.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nA container of radio buttons uses the aria role `radiogroup`, with each individual radio identified as `radio`, and uses the `aria-checked` property to denote selection.\n\nRadio buttons always use a label to ensure that their visible text label is announced alongside the radio button.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe radio component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20160317/examples/radio/radio.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Aria radio practices examples\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.a11y-101.com/development/radio-buttons\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Radio buttons\n    </ic-link>\n    , a11y-101, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/radio_role#keyboard_interactions\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Aria radio role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN web docs, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Radio button component\n    </ic-link>\n    , Government Design System, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/radio-buttons-default-selection/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Radio buttons: Select one by default or leave all unselected\n    </ic-link>\n    , Nielsen Norman Group, accessed June 2014.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

The conditional field can be set to static so that it is always visible and becomes enabled once the radio button is selected. If the conditional field is set to dynamic the field is only displayed when the radio button is selected.\n\n## When not to use\n\nDon’t use radio buttons on their own, they should always appear as part of a radio button group.\n\nDon’t use radio buttons when the user can select multiple options from the list. Use [checkboxes](/components/checkbox) instead.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig1}\n    imageAlt=\"A radio button group titled ‘What are your favourite coffees?’ with two out of six radio buttons showing as selected.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use a radio button group to allow multiple selected options from a list.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig2}\n    imageAlt=\"A checkbox group titled ‘What are your favourite coffees?’ with two out of six checkboxes selected.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use a checkbox group to allow multiple sections from a list.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nDon’t use radio buttons to turn something on or off. Use a [switch](/components/switch) instead.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig3}\n    imageAlt=\"A two option radio button group with the label ‘Turn on the coffee machine?’ with options for ‘On’ and ‘Off’.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use radio buttons to turn something on or off.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig4}\n    imageAlt=\"Two switches under the heading 'equipment'. One switch is toggled on whilst the other is off.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use a switch to toggle something on or off.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nIn most circumstances, set a default selected option from a radio button group to help people understand that something must be selected, and to expedite the completion of the input using the commonly preferred option.\n\nAlternatively, use a radio button group without a default selected option to force people to select an option before moving on. This eliminates bias towards a single option and avoids people skipping over the question by leaving the default selection.\n\n### Sizing\n\nUse small sized radio button groups to achieve compact layouts. Always use small sized components with other small sized components.\n\n### Layout and placement\n\nStack radio buttons when there are more than two options.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig5}\n    imageAlt=\"A radio button group titled ‘What milk would you like?’ with three radio buttons for ‘dairy’, ‘soya’ and ‘nut’ stacked vertically.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Always display radio buttons as a stack when there are more than two options.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig6}\n    imageAlt=\"A radio button group asking ‘What milk would you like?’ and showing three options for ‘Dairy’, ‘Soya’  and ‘Nut’ displayed in a row.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t display radio button groups with more than two options in a row.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nIf there are only two options, you can display them either stacked or in a row.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig7}\n    imageAlt=\"A radio button group asking ‘Would you like a coffee?’ with radio buttons for ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ displayed in a row. A second radio button group asking ‘What milk would you like?’ with radio buttons for ‘Dairy’ and ‘Soya’ displayed stacked.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Display radio buttons as a stack or in a row when radio button groups have two options.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Validation\n\nThere are two types of error that can occur on a radio button: a radio button input error or an error on a radio button's conditional field.\n\nA radio button input error is when the radio button group itself is responsible for the error. This is shown using the radio button error state.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig8}\n    imageAlt=\"A radio button group displayed with no radio button selected with an error message reading ‘Please select an option’.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"When there’s an issue show an error message next to the entire radio button group.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nFor errors on a radio button’s conditional field, the error is shown only on the conditional field itself and not on the parent radio button group component.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig9}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic showing a radio button group with four options and an error reading ‘Answer required’ displayed with an empty input field that is a conditional field of one of the radio buttons.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Error validation shown correctly on the field causing the error.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={radioFig10}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic showing two error labels incorrectly applied to a radio button group. One error reading ‘Answer required’ is displayed with an empty input field that is the conditional field of a radio button. The other error, also reading ‘Answer required’ is displayed with the whole radio button group.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Only display the error on the field causing it. Don’t display an error on the field as well as the radio group.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Content\n\n### Labels\n\nFollow the [content style guidelines](/styles/content-style) for radio button group labels as well as each individual radio button label. Use the radio button group label to ask the question, and use the radio button labels to provide possible answers.\n\n## Related components\n\n- [Checkbox](/components/checkbox)\n",

Including a visible search button as well as having an associated event with the input field provides multiple ways to search using the keyboard as well as the mouse.\n\nThe search variant that shows suggested options provides additional help from an accessibility perspective as it allows users to perform searches quickly without needing to fully enter their input. This is a form of autocomplete and has been made accessible using the keyboard, including **Home** and **End**, as well as the **Esc** key. This is also configured so when there isn’t enough space in the viewport for the dropdown list to fully display beneath the dropdown bar, it's displayed above the input bar.\n\nThe focus order through the search field internal elements is as follows:\n\n1. The search field and its option list.\n2. The clear button (if visible).\n3. The search button (if enabled).\n\nKeyboard users can move focus through options in the drop list using the arrow keys, whilst they can still type into the field to change their search term.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={searchBarFig7}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic highlighting the tab order between elements in a search field. The search input is annotated with a '1', the close buttons with a '2', and the search button with a '3'.\"\n    state=\"none\"\n    caption=\"Focus is applied first to the input field and its option list, then moves to the close button if visible and search button.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nThe first item in the drop list is focused by default so that if a user clicked the search button or the enter button, the associated action with that option would be triggered. This might be a link to a page, or filling the search field with the selected suggestion.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nWhen focus is received on the component, the screen-reader will announce a hint explaining how you can move up and down in the dropdown list using the **up**/**down** arrow keys.\n\nWhen the search is complete, an `aria-live` announcement is used to announce the number of results in the list.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe search bar component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/articles/autocomplete-component/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Best practices for the accessibility of an autocompletion component\n    </ic-link>\n    , Orange, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.a11ymatters.com/pattern/accessible-search/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessible Search Form\n    </ic-link>\n    , a11ymatters, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/search_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      ARIA: search role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN web docs, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Use this for searching through a known data set, such as a site search displaying individual pages as the search results (like the search on this website).\r\n\r\nSearch for an ‘espresso’ below in the search bar example.\r\n\r\n<ComponentPreview>\r\n  <IcSearchBar\r\n    label=\"What is your favourite coffee?\"\r\n    options={[\r\n      { label: \"Espresso\", value: \"espresso\" },\r\n      { label: \"Double Espresso\", value: \"doubleespresso\" },\r\n      { label: \"Flat White\", value: \"flatwhite\" },\r\n      { label: \"Cappuccino\", value: \"cappuccino\" },\r\n      { label: \"Americano\", value: \"americano\" },\r\n      { label: \"Mocha\", value: \"mocha\" },\r\n    ]}\r\n  />\r\n</ComponentPreview>\r\n\r\n### Search bar with suggested options\r\n\r\nUse the search bar with suggested options to provide search term suggestions in the drop-list. Use this type of search when you don't want to show actual search results, but instead possible or common search terms that will form the search query when submitted.\r\n\r\nUsers may select a suggested option or they may continue with searching on the term they have entered.\r\n\r\nWhen displaying suggested options, order them in the most helpful way and use the same formatting for each option presented.\r\n\r\n### Search bar only\r\n\r\nUse a search bar without a drop-list when you want to handle the search operation yourself. Use this to capture a search term and then direct a user to a custom search results page for the input query.\r\n\r\n<ComponentPreview>\r\n  <IcSearchBar label=\"What is your favourite coffee?\" />\r\n</ComponentPreview>\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nDon't use a search bar with search results if you are likely to need additional filters and advanced search settings. It's better to use a search bar with a custom search results page in this case.\r\n\r\nTake care when using a search bar with search results when you have large, complex data sets that take time to load. This can cause excessive loading times and it's best to use a custom search results page to handle and display large numbers of results.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={searchBarFig1}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A search bar with a large number of results causing long scroll length.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Avoid showing long lists of results in a search bar's search results.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nDon't use a search bar on its own, or a search bar with suggested options, if you don't have a method of displaying the results. Always include a search results page if you aren't using the search bar with search results.\r\n\r\n## Sizing\r\n\r\nUse the medium and small size options for search bars to match their size to other components in your app.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nUse clear and specific placeholder text that informs the user on the context and scope of the search.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={searchBarFig3}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example of helpful search placeholder text outlining 'search coffee drinks'.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use helpful placeholder text within a search bar to describe what the user is searching for.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={searchBarFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example of unhelpful search placeholder text outlining 'coffee'.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Don't use generic placeholder text.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\nFor searches that take time to load results or suggestions, display the loading state whilst the search is loading. Use the empty state for searches that have no results or suggested options.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={searchBarFig5}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A search bar with an entered search term that displays a loading indicator whilst the search is occurring.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use the loading state whilst results load.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={searchBarFig6}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A search bar with an entered search term that has no search results.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Tell the user when their search term yields no results.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n",

This aids swift readability as a user can scan back to the same position to start the next line of content. It supports standard reading scanning patterns by creating a consistent baseline.\n\nThe width of a section container is contrained to a maximum width on large devices in order to keep the line length to a readable size.\n\nConsistent alignment also reduces cognitive load when trying to understand content on a page and helps to associate elements to one another through proximity and symmetry.\n\n## Based on\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://nngroup.com\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence (nngroup.com)\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed December 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://interaction-design.org\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      What are the Gestalt Principles? | IxDF (interaction-design.org)\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed December 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

The following components use section containers with the specified alignments.\n\n- [Top navigation](/components/top-navigation): Full-width section container.\n- [Footer](/components/footer): Full-width section container.\n- [Hero](/components/hero): Centred section container.\n- [Page header](/components/page-header): Centred section container.\n\n## Component demo\n\n<ComponentPreview style={{ display: \"contents\" }}>\n  <IcSectionContainer style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }} aligned=\"center\">\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: \"flex\",\n        justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n        padding: \"0.5rem\",\n        gap: \"0.5rem\",\n      }}\n    >\n      <IcChip label=\"Americano\" />\n      <IcChip label=\"Cappuccino\" />\n      <IcChip label=\"Latte\" />\n    </div>\n  </IcSectionContainer>\n  <br />\n  <IcSectionContainer style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }}>\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: \"flex\",\n        justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n        padding: \"0.5rem\",\n        gap: \"0.5rem\",\n      }}\n    >\n      <IcChip label=\"Americano\" />\n      <IcChip label=\"Cappuccino\" />\n      <IcChip label=\"Latte\" />\n    </div>\n  </IcSectionContainer>\n  <br />\n  <IcSectionContainer\n    style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }}\n    aligned=\"full-width\"\n  >\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: \"flex\",\n        justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n        padding: \"0.5rem\",\n        gap: \"0.5rem\",\n      }}\n    >\n      <IcChip label=\"Americano\" />\n      <IcChip label=\"Cappuccino\" />\n      <IcChip label=\"Latte\" />\n    </div>\n  </IcSectionContainer>\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n## When to use\n\nUse a section container to group multiple elements and align them on a page. Use multiple section containers to ensure alignment between them all.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={image1}\n  imageAlt=\"A page showing section containers used to align content to the centre of the viewport.\"\n  caption=\"Use section containers maintain alignment across a page.\"\n/>\n\n## When not to use\n\nAvoid nesting section containers as it can be difficult to maintain alignment. Instead, use multiple section containers to align each group of content differently.\n\n## Sizing\n\nThe size of the section container changes dependent on the size of the viewport. The margins and maximum width of the container are automatically set so that the content will respond to changes in the viewport.\n\nMake a section container full height to remove the vertical padding and help align vertical content more easily.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={image2}\n  imageAlt=\"Two section containers. The first section container has vertical padding included at the top and bottom of the container, whereas the second section container is full-height and has no vertical padding.\"\n  caption=\"Make section containers full height to remove vertical padding and easily space content vertically.\"\n/>\n\n## Layout and placement\n\nUse the alignment properties of the section container to change how they align with the viewport.\n\nUse centre alignment to position the section container in the centre of the viewport.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={image3}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of a page with three section containers with centred alignment appearing in the middle of the viewport.\"\n  caption=\"Section containers using centred alignment.\"\n/>\n\nUse left alignment to position the section container to the left of the viewport.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={image4}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of a page with three section containers with left alignment appearing to the left of the viewport.\"\n  caption=\"Section containers using left alignment.\"\n/>\n\nUse full-width alignment to make the section container span the full width of the viewport.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={image5}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of a page with three section containers with full-width alignment stretching to the edges of the viewport.\"\n  caption=\"Section containers using full-width alignment.\"\n/>\n\n## Content\n\nGroup any combination of content within a section container. Align the content relative to the section container. By default content is aligned to the left, but overide this to create custom internal layouts, whilst having the section align automatically with other containers on the page.\n\n## Future work on this component\n\n- Add grids to section container to align internal content.\n\n## Related components\n\n- [Layout and spacing](/styles/layout-spacing)\n",

When the query length is less than the required the `aria status` region provides helpful text informing the user they should type in more.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nWhen focus is received on the component, the screen-reader will announce a hint explaining how you can navigate up and down in the dropdown list (with the **up** and **down** arrow keys).\n\nWhen the search (asynchronous or otherwise) is complete, there is an `aria-live` announcement to announce the number of results in the list.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe select component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.24a11y.com/2019/select-your-poison/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Select your poison\n    </ic-link>\n    , 24 Accessibility, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/listbox_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      ARIA: listbox role\n    </ic-link>\n    , Mozilla, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Menus & Menu Buttons\n    </ic-link>\n    , Inclusive Components, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-autocomplete\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      aria-autocomplete\n    </ic-link>\n    , Mozilla, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Any custom elements used should be non-interactive, such as status tags or icons.\r\n\r\nUse a default option list to display all options without any grouping or recommendations.\r\n\r\n#### Recommended\r\n\r\nUse an option list with recommendations to display specific options at the top of the list for quick access.\r\n\r\n#### Groups\r\n\r\nUse an option list with groups to combine the options into groups with descriptive headings.\r\n\r\n### Labels\r\n\r\nClear labels help users understand what information they should provide.\r\n\r\nLabels should always be visible regardless of the state of the field and should be announced by a screen reader on focus.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={selectFig3}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a select component with the label 'Coffee type' and placeholder text 'Select one'.\"\r\n    state=\"good\"\r\n    caption=\"Use labels to indicate the title of the field.\"\r\n  />\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={selectFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a select component with no label and the placeholder text 'Coffee type'.\"\r\n    state=\"bad\"\r\n    caption=\"Don't replace labels with placeholder text.\"\r\n  />\r\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n\r\n### Helper text\r\n\r\nHelper text should be included when additional information can help the user to either provide the right information or understand why or how the information will be used.\r\n\r\nMake sure any helper text that appears under an input is read when an assistive technology user stops at an input using ARIA.\r\n\r\n### Dismissible inputs\r\n\r\nAlways allow the user to clear their selection by including a clear button inside the input field.\r\n\r\n## Searchable (single-select)\r\n\r\nexport const SearchableSelectExample = () => (\r\n  <IcSelect\r\n    label=\"What is your favourite coffee?\"\r\n    options={[\r\n      { label: \"Cappuccino\", value: \"Cap\" },\r\n      { label: \"Latte\", value: \"Lat\" },\r\n      { label: \"Americano\", value: \"Ame\" },\r\n      { label: \"Flat white\", value: \"Fla\" },\r\n      { label: \"Mocha\", value: \"Moc\" },\r\n      { label: \"Macchiato\", value: \"Mac\" },\r\n      { label: \"Café au lait\", value: \"Caf\" },\r\n      { label: \"Espresso\", value: \"Esp\" },\r\n      { label: \"Cortado\", value: \"Cor\" },\r\n      { label: \"Latte macchiato\", value: \"Lam\" },\r\n    ]}\r\n    searchable\r\n    onIcChange={(event) => console.log(event.detail.value)}\r\n  />\r\n);\r\n\r\n<ComponentPreview>\r\n  <SearchableSelectExample />\r\n</ComponentPreview>\r\n\r\nThe single-select component can be set to be searchable to filter options in the option list. A user can open the option list to view the available options, but can also type into the input field to filter the option list to more easily find the desired option.\r\n\r\nUse the searchable variant when including several options in the option list, so that the user can quickly filter their desired selection.\r\n\r\nDon’t use the searchable variant when providing less than ten options.

It also uses a `navigation` landmark to allow quick navigation from anywhere within a page's content.\n\nThe side navigation is essentially a group of links ordered vertically in the component. Tabbing through the side navigation content follows the logical order by moving from the top most item to the bottom most item, with the expansion toggle button being the last focusable element in the component before focus is moved to page content.\n\nIn a collapsed side navigation, menu option labels are always available in a tooltip by hovering or focusing on the icon button. Any truncated text can also be accessed through use of tooltips in this way.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nIcon-only menu options have accessible labels that are announced by a screen reader when focused.\n\nCollapsible option groups use `aria-expanded` to indicate whether the group is open or closed. If closed, focus skips over the group's content to the next elements. If open, each menu item in the group is included in the tab order. Collapsible option groups can be opened or closed using the **enter** or **space** key.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe side navigation component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed June 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.aditus.io/patterns/accordion/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessible Accordion\n    </ic-link>\n    , Aditus.io, accessed June 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/accordion/accordion.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accordion Example\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed June 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

to use\r\n\r\nUse side navigation to help provide more screen space for the main content. Side navigation is well suited to apps that have mutually exclusive features that need to be switched between easily on any page.\r\n\r\nUse side navigation alongside additional components like [page headers](/components/page-header) to create a variety of different [layouts](/styles/layout-spacing) and navigation styles.\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nFor intranet-style and content-heavy apps, use [top navigation](/components/top-navigation) as it's better suited for providing links to a large number of pages.\r\n\r\nUse either side navigation or top navigation. Don't use both at the same time.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app that shows a top navigation and side navigation used on the same page.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don't use both side navigation and top navigation at the same time.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAvoid using side navigation if the app has many destinations grouped into a multi-level hierarchy. Instead use a [top navigation](/components/top-navigation) with grouped links.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig2}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app using side navigation to display multiple groups of links.\"\r\n  state=\"caution\"\r\n  caption=\"Avoid using side navigation for apps with complex page hierarchies. Instead use top navigation with grouped links.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Interaction behaviour\r\n\r\nSide navigation is expandable and displays the navigation labels and app info when expanded. Choose whether to display the side navigation as expanded or collapsed by default when the page loads.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig3}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example of an application with the side navigation expanded or collapsed by default as the page loads.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Choose to display the side navigation as collapsed or expanded when the page loads.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSet the side navigation to static if you want it to be either permanently expanded or permanently collapsed. This removes the expansion toggle button from the bottom of the side navigation.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig4}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Two examples of side navigation that are set to static collapsed and static expanded. No expansion toggle button is displayed in the bottom section of the side navigation.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Static side navigation examples.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nUse a drill-down menu option to provide access to child links in a sub-menu. The sub-menu can be closed by using the back button in the sub-menu's top section.\r\n\r\nSub-menus can be nested, but avoid creating overly deep page hierarchies and consider using top navigation with grouped links instead.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig5}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example side navigation component showing a menu option with a sub-menu of child links.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"A side navigation component with a sub-menu.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Colour\r\n\r\nThe side navigation uses the app's [theme colour](/styles/colour/#theme) as the background and automatically sets the foreground colour to ensure accessible contrast ratios. Change the app's theme colour to change the background colour of the side navigation and help distinguish your app from others your users may use.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig6}\r\n  imageAlt=\"Two examples of side navigation components using different theme colours.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Examples of side navigation using different theme colours.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\nAlways position the side navigation on the left hand of the screen and make sure that it vertically fills the browser window.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig7}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example app with a side navigation component that sits above the footer.\"\r\n  state=\"bad\"\r\n  caption=\"Don't position the side navigation so that it does not vertically fill the browser window.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\n### App information\r\n\r\nUse your app's name, icon, status and version information in the side navigation's app info fields.\r\n\r\n### Labels and icons\r\n\r\nFollow the [content style guidelines](/styles/content-style) for all menu option labels as well as each option group labels.\r\n\r\nFollow the [icon style guidelines](/styles/icons) when selecting icons for menu options.\r\n\r\nKeep labels concise as they will truncate if they are too long to display in the side navigation.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig8}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example side navigation showing menu items with long labels that are truncated.\"\r\n  state=\"caution\"\r\n  caption=\"Keep labels concise to avoid truncation.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Menu items\r\n\r\nSet the side navigation menu items to reflect your app's main navigation links.\r\n\r\nBy default, menu items will only display their icon when the side navigation is collapsed. The item label will be displayed via a tooltip when hovering or focusing on the menu item.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig9}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example side navigation component showing the menu option labels in a tooltip when hovering or focusing on the menu option.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Side navigation shows menu item labels using tooltips when collapsed.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSet the menu items to display their labels in the collapsed state by default if this will aid the recognition of the feature. However, take care when doing this as long menu item labels will be truncated.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig10}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example side navigation in collapsed state showing labels below the icons for each menu option.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Set menu items to display their labels even in the collapsed state if this aids recognition of the feature.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nGroup related menu items into expandable menu item groups.\r\n\r\nUse a drill-down menu item if the menu item has a large number of child links to display. This will display the child links in the side navigation's sub-menu.\r\n\r\n<IcAlert\r\n  heading=\"Coming soon\"\r\n  message=\"Drill-down menu functionality is in development.\"\r\n  variant=\"info\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationFig11}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An example of side navigation showing grouped menu items and drill-down menu items.\"\r\n  state=\"good\"\r\n  caption=\"Side navigation showing grouped menu items and drill-down menu items.\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Bottom menu items\r\n\r\nUse the sticky bottom menu section to provide quick links to global app features or external links.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility considerations\r\n\r\nMake sure to include alt-text when specifying icons for menu items.\r\n\r\n## Related Components\r\n\r\n- [Top navigation](/components/top-navigation)\r\n",

Skeletons use the `aria-busy` to tell assistive technologies that the container is loading. Aria-busy will be false when the container isn't refreshing and will be equal to true when the content is loading.\n\nGiven that few screen readers comply with `aria-busy=”true”`, we need to invoke `aria-hidden=”true”` to hide the busy content.\n\nSkeleton components shouldn’t be focusable.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe skeleton component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.tpgi.com/short-note-on-being-busy/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Short note on being busy\n    </ic-link>\n    , Steve Faulkner, accessed April 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/11/more-accessible-skeletons.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      More Accessible Skeletons\n    </ic-link>\n    , Adrian Roselli, accessed April 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://dockyard.com/blog/2020/03/02/accessible-loading-indicatorswith-no-extra-elements\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Accessible Loading Indicators—with No Extra Elements!\n    </ic-link>\n    , James Steinbach, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. It’s been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.\n\n## Future research planned\n\nTo meet WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 2.2.2 we need to include a mechanism to stop “any moving, blinking or scrolling information that starts automatically, lasts more than five seconds, and is presented in parallel with other content”. As the animation is subtle and less than one second we don't need to provide this.\n\nHowever, we could do further research into potential scenarios where it could be beneficial for specific users, and how to invoke the pausing pattern without affecting the general experience.\n",

This applies to helper text for input labels, headings and body text.\n\n### Rectangle\n\nUse the rectangle variant as a placeholder for any other components. This includes buttons, chips and tags, input fields and cards.\n\n## When to use\n\nUse skeleton variants as a placeholder for when a full page or individual components are loading. Don't nest skeletons. If a label or text is wrapped inside a component, for example in cards, only use the skeleton variant of the component that wraps the other components.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={skeletonFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"An image which shows the card component and the rectangle skeleton variant used to replace the full card width and height while it’s loading.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use skeletons to outline the whole component.\"\n/>\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={skeletonFig2}\n  imageAlt=\"An image showing a card component’s skeleton state including text skeleton variants used within another rectangle skeleton variant.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don't use skeletons within skeletons.\"\n/>\n\n### Sizing\n\nSet the height and width of the skeleton to match the size of the component that will replace it once loaded.\n\nWhen using the text variant, set the skeleton’s height to match the text style of the text that will replace it once loaded.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={skeletonFig3}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a list of text styles side by side with the correct text variant height.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use the correct text style to match the size of the text.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={skeletonFig4}\n    imageAlt=\"A graphic of a list of different text styles side by side with a list of skeleton components of the same height.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don't use the same skeleton size for different text sizes.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nDon't replace large bodies of texts with one single large text skeleton.

If needed, manually specify a 300ms delay, after which the skeleton component is displayed.\n\nDon’t use skeleton loading states when the loading progress can be calculated. Instead, use [determinate loading indicators](/components/loading-indicator).\n\nDon’t use skeleton components when the general structure of the page that will replace skeleton variants is not known.

Steps are displayed from left to right and show the direction of movement through the process.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={stepperFig1}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An image showing a form titled 'Make a coffee' featuring a stepper with four steps, titled 'Take order', 'Make drink', 'Take payment', and 'Finish'.

This gives a sense of control and describes their position in the process in relation to where they have been, as well as how much they have left to do.\r\n\r\n## When not to use\r\n\r\nDon't use the stepper to indicate a non-linear process where steps can be completed in any order. Linear processes require each step to be completed in order.\r\n\r\n## Interaction behaviour\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\nSteps are single elements that together form the stepper. Steps have four different states:\r\n\r\n- Active: Indicates that the step is available but not yet completed by the user. This step type is rendered as current if displayed in the compact stepper.\r\n\r\n- Current: Shows the step the user is currently on.\r\n\r\n- Completed: Shows a previous step that has been completed by the user.\r\n\r\n- Disabled: Shows a step that is unavailable. This could be because it's conditional on another step. If a step is always unavailable, then it should not be included in the stepper when it's loaded.\r\n\r\n<ComponentPreview>\r\n  <IcStepper>\r\n    <IcStep heading=\"Add details\" type=\"completed\" />\r\n    <IcStep heading=\"Customer\" type=\"current\" />\r\n    <IcStep heading=\"Upload\" />\r\n    <IcStep heading=\"Submit\" type=\"disabled\" />\r\n  </IcStepper>\r\n</ComponentPreview>\r\n\r\n## Layout and placement\r\n\r\nAlways align steppers to the left and place them above the main body content of the page.\r\n\r\n<DoDontCaution\r\n  imageSrc={stepperFig6}\r\n  imageAlt=\"An image showing a stepper with four steps, titled 'Warm kettle', 'Add milk', 'Pour water', and 'Drink coffee'.

Don't use a switch if there is no default setting. Instead, use checkboxes or two [radio buttons](/components/radio).\r\n\r\nDon't use a switch as an input in a form. Use them to instantaneously control a single option.\r\n\r\nDon't use a switch for 'yes' or 'no' answers. Use two [radio buttons](/components/radio) instead.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={switchFig3}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example settings panel with a single switch with a heading that says 'Do you want to receive notifications?''.

A change in a switch's state should always be the user's decision.\r\n\r\n<video width=\"50%\" muted controls loop>\r\n  <source src={switchVid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n</video>\r\n\r\n<IcTypography\r\n  variant=\"label\"\r\n  style={{ marginTop: \"-1rem\", marginBottom: \"1.5rem\" }}\r\n>\r\n  Avoid changing a switch's state without the user’s specific instruction.\r\n</IcTypography>\r\n\r\n## Sizing\r\n\r\nUse a medium sized switch in most scenarios where other medium sized components are used.\r\n\r\nUse a small sized switch with other small sized components for compact layouts.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nUse clear labels so that it's obvious what the switch will do when in the 'on' or 'off' position. Don't make them neutral or ambiguous. The switch should read 'Label: on' or 'Label: off'.\r\n\r\nFor example, a switch to turn notifications 'on' or 'off', with a label that says 'Notifications', is understandable when read as 'Notifications: on' and 'Notifications: off'. If the label said 'Turn notifications off', it's ambiguous and more difficult to understand what the 'on' and 'off' position will do.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={switchFig4}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example settings panel with a single switch in the 'off' position.

The position of the switch describes this itself. Changing the label between state changes makes it difficult to understand the current state.\r\n\r\n<video width=\"50%\" muted controls loop>\r\n  <source src={switchVid2} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n</video>\r\n\r\n<IcTypography\r\n  variant=\"label\"\r\n  style={{ marginTop: \"-1rem\", marginBottom: \"1.5rem\" }}\r\n>\r\n  Don’t change the switch’s label at the same time as the state changes.\r\n</IcTypography>\r\n\r\nUse an icon with a switch label only if it aids the recognition of the option.\r\n\r\nDon't group switches with icons with other switches without icons.\r\n\r\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\r\n  <DoDontCaution\r\n    imageSrc={switchFig6}\r\n    imageAlt=\"An example settings panel with three switches.

The tab bar acts as a single focusable element, whilst its tabs can be individually focused using the **arrow** keys. This avoids the user having to move focus through every tab in order to reach the content.\n\nInstead, they move focus into the tab bar, focus on the tab they wish to view using the **arrow** keys, select it using the **space** or **enter** key, and can then directly move focus to the content within the selected tab. Using **shift+tab** moves focus back to the tab bar and highlights the currently selected tab.\n\nUsing the **home** key moves focus to the first tab in the tab bar, and the **end** key moves focus to the last tab.\n\nWhen a compact version of a tab bar is displayed, the tabs can be accessed using the same keyboard functionality described above. When focus is moved to different tabs, the compact tab bar automatically scrolls to show the currently focused tab in the visible area.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nUsing the arrow keys in screen readers allows people to move between all elements of the page. When a selected tab is focused on, the down arrow key would tell the screen reader to move to the first element within the tab's content. Each tab container is labelled by the tab it relates to so that the relationship between them is clear when using a screen reader.\n\n## Based on\n\nThis tabs component is based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Tabbed Interfaces, Inclusive Components\n    </ic-link>\n    , Heydon Pickering, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Example of tabs with automatic activation\n    </ic-link>\n    , w3, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/tabs/tabs-2/tabs.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Example of tabs with manual activation\n    </ic-link>\n    , w3, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_selection_follows_focus\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Deciding when to make selection automatically follow focus\n    </ic-link>\n    , WAI Aria Practices, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Tabs display one section at a time.\n\nAlways consider the amount of content presented on one page and decide if it can be reduced or split across multiple pages to make it more digestible instead of placing into tabs.\n\n## When not to use\n\nDon’t use tabs if the order of the content is important, such as in a checkout process. Instead use a [stepper](/components/stepper) to order the sections into a linear process.\n\nDon’t use tabs if the content on different tabs needs to be compared.\n\n## Colour\n\nUse a dark tab bar on light backgrounds and use a light tab bar on darker backgrounds.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={tabsFig1}\n    imageAlt=\"A recipe site showing a recipe titled ‘Hazelnut macchiato recipe’.

The recipe sits on a dark blue background and has a light tab bar with two tabs for ‘Ingredients’ and ‘Method’.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use a light tab bar on dark backgrounds.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Layout and placement\n\nAlways place tabs directly above the content container that they control.\n\nDon’t position tabs so that they are unconnected from the content that belongs to them.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={tabsFig3}\n  imageAlt=\"A recipe site showing a page titled ‘Hazelnut macchiato recipe’. The page title has a tab bar showing two tabs ‘Ingredients’ and ‘Method’. Between the tab bar and the tab container is a link to ‘our menu’.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don’t separate the tab container from the tab bar.\"\n/>\n\nOn smaller screen sizes, tab bars with a large number of tabs will collapse into a compact tab selector instead.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={tabsFig4}\n    imageAlt=\"A recipe site showing a page titled ‘Hazelnut macchiato recipe’.

Scroll controls are added to navigate through the tab bar.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Content\n\n### Labels\n\nKeep labels short and informative so that the tab’s content is clear. Tab labels always display on one line, so keeping them short means that more tabs can be displayed if required.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={tabsFig5}\n    imageAlt=\"A recipe page showing a tab bar with two tabs labelled ‘Ingredients’ and ‘Method’.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use concise labels on tabs.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={tabsFig6}\n    imageAlt=\"A recipe page showing a tab bar with two tabs labelled ‘This is what goes in it’ and 'How it's made’.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use long labels.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n### Order of tabs\n\nArrange the tabs in an order that makes the most sense in context. Always show the first tab by default when the page loads. Place the most important content in the first tab.\n\nAvoid using six or more tabs as this may add too much complexity to the page. Consider if content can be reduced or split across multiple pages instead.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={tabsFig7}\n  imageAlt=\"A recipe page with a tab bar with six tabs.\"\n  state=\"caution\"\n  caption=\"Avoid using too many tabs as it can complicate the page.\"\n/>\n\n### Icons\n\nAdd icons to tab labels to provide an extra visual cue to the tab’s content. Ensure that icons are relevant to the tab content.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={tabsFig8}\n    imageAlt=\"A tab bar with two icon tabs labelled ‘Ingredients’ and ‘Method’. The ingredients tab has a fridge icon and the method tab has a checklist icon.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use clear icons on tab labels.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={tabsFig9}\n    imageAlt=\"A tab bar with two icon tabs labelled ‘Ingredients’ and ‘Method’. Both icons are difficult to understand as they don't clearly match the label.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use ambiguous icons.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nDon’t use icons for some tabs and not others. Always apply icons to all tabs if using them.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={tabsFig10}\n  imageAlt=\" A recipe page that shows a tab bar with three tabs. Only one tab out of the three uses an icon.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don’t mix normal tabs with icon tabs. Use either all normal tabs or all icon tabs.\"\n/>\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen deciding to use tabs, consider whether this component gives users the most understandable and usable way of navigating between the content.\n\nConsider laying out your content into a single page with anchor links to move between sections.\n\nAlso consider using other containers that are more suited to responsive behaviour such as accordions, which use a single column.\n",

A user can also hover over the toast with their mouse to pause the timer. Auto-dismiss toasts also include a visual timer, to show how long remains until it disappears.\n\nIf any actions are included within a toast, then it can’t be set to auto-dismiss. This gives a user extra time to locate and trigger the action.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nAuto-dismissible toasts use a role of alert, which uses an `aria-live` region to announce the contents immediately to users of assistive technology.\n\nToasts that don't auto-dismiss use a role of dialog and focus is moved to the toast when displayed. After dismissing the toast, focus is returned to the same position on the page that was focused before the toast was displayed. Focus is also trapped between the toast's interactive elements, so that users can complete the action quickly and easily.\n\nPressing `Escape` on the keyboard will dismiss manual toasts immediately.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe toast component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/07/08/a-toast-to-a11y-toasts.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      A toast to a11y toasts\n    </ic-link>\n    , Scott O’Hara, accessed March 20222.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2019/06/scraping-burned-toast.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Scraping burned toast\n    </ic-link>\n    , Adrian Roselli, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/01/defining-toast-messages.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Defining toast messages\n    </ic-link>\n    , Adrian Roselli, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      2.2.1 Timing adjustable\n    </ic-link>\n    , WCAG 2.2, accessed April 2024.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Dialog role\n    </ic-link>\n    , MDN web docs, accessed March 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

Avoid using toasts as the only method of conveying information to the user.\n\nToasts can be set to disappear on their own, or remain visible on screen until actioned. Toasts that automatically disappear should not contain any essential information.\n\nAn action, such as a link or button, can be included but isn’t recommended. Try to place actions in the main content of the page instead. If an action is included, then the toast can't be set to automatically dismiss.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={toastFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"A comments section with a toast message that says ‘Comment added’ with an ‘undo’ button and a dismiss button.\"\n  state=\"caution\"\n  caption=\"A toast message containing an action button. The toast has to be manually dismissed.\"\n/>\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={toastFig2}\n  imageAlt=\"A comments section with a toast message that says ‘Comment added’ with a link that reads ‘View our privacy statement’, and a dismiss button.\"\n  state=\"caution\"\n  caption=\"A toast message containing a link. The toast has to be manually dismissed.\"\n/>\n\nIt's best to use toasts for passive success messages, for example 'document saved'. This provides useful additional feedback about the completion of a process, without being the only method of conveying this information.\n\n## When not to use\n\nIf the message must be seen, use an [alert](/components/alert) or dialog depending on the severity of the problem.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={toastFig3}\n  imageAlt=\"A comments section with a toast message displaying an error that reads ‘Your comment couldn’t be saved’.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don’t use toast messages to display errors.\"\n/>\n\nUse a dialog to display messages a user must see or acknowledge.\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\n### Action\n\nUse a single action in a toast. A button or link can be provided, but the toast can't automatically dismiss if an action is included.\n\n### Auto-dismiss\n\nToasts can be set to auto-dismiss after an adjustable length of time. Make sure that auto-dismissing toasts are displayed for long enough for their content to be read. Make sure the toast content is non-critical so it doesn’t matter if it's missed.\n\n<video width=\"100%\" muted controls loop>\n  <source src={toastVid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n<IcTypography\n  variant=\"label\"\n  style={{ marginTop: \"-1rem\", marginBottom: \"1.5rem\" }}\n>\n  A page with a toast that appears at the bottom center of the screen and\n  disappears after a short delay.\n</IcTypography>\n\nToasts that contain an action or link can’t be set to auto-dismiss.\n\nToasts that don’t auto-dismiss will have a close button.\n\n<video width=\"100%\" muted controls loop>\n  <source src={toastVid2} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n<IcTypography\n  variant=\"label\"\n  style={{ marginTop: \"-1rem\", marginBottom: \"1.5rem\" }}\n>\n  A page with a toast, that has a close button, that appears at the bottom\n  center of the screen and disappears only when the dismiss button is clicked.\n</IcTypography>\n\n### Layout and placement\n\nToasts always appear centred at the bottom of the screen. Positioning toasts here makes sure that they don't obscure key content or navigation that might be positioned at the top of the screen.\n\nOnly one toast can be displayed at a time. If multiple toasts are required, they are queued one after the other.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={toastFig4}\n  imageAlt=\"An app called ‘Better latte than never’ displaying an article page and showing a toast message positioned at the bottom and centre of the screen that reads ‘Comment added’.  \"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Position toast message at the centre and bottom of the screen.  \"\n/>\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={toastFig5}\n  imageAlt=\"An app whose title is obscured by a toast message positioned at the top of the screen that reads ‘Comment added’.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don’t position toasts at the top of the screen as they may interfere with important content.  \"\n/>\n\n## Content\n\nUse short messages in toasts. Use the optional description text in addition to the toast title for additional content.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={toastFig6}\n  imageAlt=\"An app called ‘Better latte than never’ showing an article page with comments that displays a toast message with a title that says ‘Comment added’ and a description that says ‘Thanks for letting us know.’.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Use the optional toast description to provide more information on the toast message.\"\n/>\n\nUse one of the following statuses to provide additional meaning to the message:\n\n- Success\n- Warning\n- Error\n- Info\n- Status unknown\n\nSpecify a custom icon when using status unknown. Make sure that the icon is related to the toast’s content and that an alt-text description is provided.\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\n<p>\n  When using an auto-dismissible toast message, the app needs to provide a\n  method to extend the duration of the message. This is to satisfy the{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n## Related components\n\n- [Alert](/components/alert)\n- [App errors](/patterns/app-errors)\n- [Success messages](/patterns/success)\n",

They work well where space is limited but this means they do not include other labels that can be used to explain their purpose. Therefore, it is always important to make sure that the visible label makes sense when in either the ‘on’ or ‘off’ position.\n\nIt is important that the selected state can be clearly identified from the unselected state. To conform with the WCAG criteria [1.4.1 Use of color](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#use-of-color), the toggle button does not solely rely on colour to indicate the selection state, but instead makes use of an additional shape added to the interior of the button to clearly distinguish it from its unselected state.\n\nThe toggle button is based upon the [button component](../components/button) so that it inherits the accessibility functionality from that component.\n\nA toggle button group can be set to either single-select or multi-select, and has settings that allow automatic selection or manual selection of its options as each toggle button is navigated through. This helps to speed up selection in a single-select toggle button group. However, this does change the keyboard interaction.\n\nFor a single select group, the whole group is focussed upon using the ‘tab’ key and the options are navigated using the ‘arrow’ keys, such as with a [radio button group](../components/radio). For a multi-select group each toggle button in the group is individually focusable with the ‘tab’ key.\n\nWhen an individual toggle button is focussed, either on its own or within a toggle button group, it can be actioned by using the ‘enter’ or ‘space’ keys.\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nWhen a toggle button is navigated to using a screen reader, its label is announced along with its selection status and its role. If an aria-label has been provided, then this will be announced instead of the visible label. This allows additional context to be provided for screen reader users who may not be able to pick up on visual cues elsewhere on the page.\n\nThe selection state is also appended to the aria-label to make sure that it is correctly announced by all screen readers.\n\nWhen a toggle button is set to disabled, it uses aria-disabled so that it is still perceivable even though it is not editable.\n\n## Based on\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/toggle-button/\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Toggle button, Inclusive Components\n    </ic-link>\n    , published 31st March 2017, accessed February 2023.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      ARIA: button role, MDN Web Docs\n    </ic-link>\n    , accessed February 2023.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

It is similar to a [switch](/components/switch) but can be grouped into denser layouts, for example within a toolbar.\n\nAn icon toggle button provides the same functionality but removes the visible text label in favour of an icon to represent its meaning.\n\n<ComponentPreview>\n  <IcToggleButton label=\"Switch to oat milk\">\n    <svg slot=\"icon\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n      <path d=\"M2,21V19H20V21H2M20,8V5H18V8H20M20,3A2,2 0 0,1 22,5V8A2,2 0 0,1 20,10H18V13A4,4 0 0,1 14,17H8A4,4 0 0,1 4,13V3H20M16,5H6V13A2,2 0 0,0 8,15H14A2,2 0 0,0 16,13V5Z\" />\n    </svg>\n  </IcToggleButton>\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n## When to use\n\nUse a standalone toggle button to provide access to a single option that can be toggled ‘on’ or ‘off’. Make sure to clearly label the toggle button so that it is clear what toggling the setting would achieve.\n\nFor example, use a standalone toggle button for a mute button in an audio player.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={toggleFig1}\n    imageAlt=\"A standalone toggle button used for a mute button in an audio player.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use a standalone toggle button for a mute button to indicate when the setting is enabled or disabled.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nUse toggle buttons in dense layouts or sections of an app that don’t have a lot of space. Use other selection methods, such as [radio buttons](/components/radio) or [switches](/components/switch), when there is more space to include more text labelling.\n\nFor example, use toggle buttons when creating a toolbar as the small size and contained selection states allow for multiple settings to be organised within a small space.\n\nUse an icon toggle button to provide a setting with no text label, but an icon instead. Take care when selecting the icon so that it is clear what the setting is and always provide an accessible label so that it can be understood by users of assistive technology.\n\nGroup toggle buttons to provide multiple options for a setting or control. Select whether the toggle button group can have multiple options toggled on at one time, or if only one should be selected at a time.\n\nFor example, use a multi-select toggle button group to provide text styling options in a text editor where an item of text could be set to bold as well as italic.\n\nSimilarly, use a single-select toggle button group to provide text alignment options in a text editor where an item of text can only have one alignment option at a time.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={toggleFig2}\n    imageAlt=\"A toggle button group used for text styling options including bold, italic, underline and strikethrough, and a second toggle button group used for text alignment options including left, centre, right, and justified.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use toggle button groups to provide multiple options for a setting such as text styling options.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## When not to use\n\nConsider whether toggle buttons are the best selection method for your use case. [Radio buttons](/components/radio), [checkboxes](/components/checkboxes) and [switches](/components/switch) provide alternative methods of proving a selection.\n\nAvoid using toggle buttons or toggle button groups to capture input within a form, instead use checkboxes or radio buttons.\n\nAvoid using toggle buttons to control the state of another content section in your app. Instead, use [tabs](/components/tabs) for switching views.\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nWhen implementing a toggle button group, set the selection type to either single-select or multi-select. Single-select allows only one option to be selected at a time, where multi-select allows multiple options to be selected.\n\nIf using a single-select toggle button group, choose whether the selection method should be automatic or manual. The automatic selection method selects the option as you navigate through the options, whereas manual selection requires the option to be manually selected after navigating to it.\n\nUse manual selection if no selected option is viable for the toggle button group.\n\nFor example, an audio player could use a toggle button group for its play, fast forward and rewind buttons. Only one option can be selected at a time, but all options can also be turned off.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={toggleFig3}\n    imageAlt=\"An audio player’s play, fast forward and rewind buttons where all toggle buttons can be deselected at the same time.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use a single select group with manual selection to allow all options in a toggle button group to be deselected at the same time.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Colour\n\nUse the appearance options when placing toggle buttons on different coloured backgrounds. This makes sure that a good colour contrast can be achieved in adherence to the accessibility guidelines.\n\nDon’t mix different appearance buttons in the same toggle button group, always use the same appearance for all toggle buttons within a group.\n\nDon’t re-colour the icons in a toggle button, make sure they match the text label so that they also achieve a high colour contrast ratio.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={toggleFig4}\n    imageAlt=\"Two versions of a text styling setting that uses toggle button groups. One has a dark background with light appearance toggle buttons, and the other has a light coloured background with dark appearance toggle button groups.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use the appearance options to achieve good contrast on different coloured backgrounds.\"\n  />\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={toggleFig5}\n    imageAlt=\"A text styling setting that uses toggle button groups. Within the toggle button groups different toggle buttons use different appearance options.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t mix appearance options together in the same toggle button group.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Sizing\n\nUse the size options to resize the toggle buttons. Match the selected size to other components in the same section so that they are vertically aligned.\n\nSet a custom width for a toggle button instead of the default behaviour that hugs the toggle button’s label or icon. Text labels will wrap onto multiple lines if the custom width is too small to fit the label in one line.\n\nUse the full width properties to make the toggle button or toggle button group expand to horizontally fill its container.\n\n## Content\n\nTake care when choosing a toggle button’s text label so that it is clear what will happen when it is toggled ‘on’ or ‘off’. Don’t use neutral or ambiguous labels. The toggle button should be read ‘label: on’ or ‘label: off’.\n\nDon’t change the text label on a toggle button between different selection states as it causes it to become ambiguous as to what state it is in. Instead, keep the label the same, but use the icon to indicate a change in state.\n\nFor example, when using a toggle button for a mute button, the label should read ‘mute’ and the state of the button indicates whether ‘mute’ is ‘on’ or ‘off’. The change in icon also helps to indicate the current state.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={toggleFig6}\n    imageAlt=\"An example of an audio player with a mute button. The button reads ‘mute’ when the button is toggled either on or off.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Use consistent labels between states on a toggle button to avoid confusion.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nUse an icon on a toggle button to add a visual indicator of its function. Take care to choose an appropriate icon that clearly represents the toggle button’s function and doesn’t introduce ambiguity into its meaning.\n\nSet the icon position to be either left, right or above the text label. Don’t use different icon positions on different toggle buttons within a toggle button group. Use the toggle button group’s icon position to set all toggle buttons’ icons to the same position.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={toggleFig7}\n    imageAlt=\"A text alignment setting with three options for left, centre and right. Each button has its icon positioned differently on the toggle button.\"\n    state=\"bad\"\n    caption=\"Don’t mix icon positions on buttons within the same group.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\nAim to only include two to six toggle buttons within a toggle button group. The larger the number of buttons the less horizontal space is available to display the labels. If more options are required, consider using a [popover menu](/components/popover-menu) instead.\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen labelling toggle buttons, consider adding an accessible label that includes the visible label. This provides more context to users of assistive technology.\n\nAlways provide an accessible label when using icon toggle buttons as this is what identifies the purpose of the icon toggle buttons to screen readers.\n\nWhen using a toggle button group, set a label for the group explaining the setting. This is not displayed visibly but is used to identify the group when navigated using assistive technology.\n\nSelect the optimal appearance option when using toggle buttons on different coloured backgrounds to maximise the colour contrast. User interface controls need to achieve 3:1 ratio with adjacent colours.\n\n## Related components\n\n- [Switch](/Components/switch)\n- [Radio button](/Components/radio)\n- [Checkbox](/Components/checkbox)\n- [Popover menu](/Components/popover-menu)\n",

Instead, include vital information on the page itself.\n\nDon't use tooltips if its content is unnecessary. Not every element needs to have a tooltip.\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nTooltips are triggered by hovering over its associated element, or by focusing on it. Make sure the tooltip is displayed the whole time the associated element is focused or hovered over.\n\nMoving the pointer over the tooltip's content maintains the tooltip visibility even if the pointer has moved out of the associated element's area.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={tooltipsFig3}\n    imageAlt=\"A button showing a tooltip with the cursor hovering over the button, and a second button showing a tooltip with the cursor hovering over the tooltip content.\"\n    state=\"good\"\n    caption=\"Tooltips display when hovering over the triggering element or the tooltip itself.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Sizing\n\nSet the width of a tooltip to contain the content.

Don't provide more than one sentence in a tooltip. If a lot of information is required in a tooltip, consider placing it on the page content itself.\n\nInclude an icon on a tooltip if it helps to provide additional meaning, but don't use icons if they don't add anything.\n\nDon't include links or other interactive content within a tooltip.

This will extend the height of the top navigation, shifting other content down.\n\nFocus will move to the search bar automatically, allowing users to begin typing their query. When focus is moved from the search bar, the search bar will be hidden and focus is returned to the search button unless it was moved elsewhere. When the search bar is next opened, any input previously entered should persist.\n\nAll individual components used within the top navigation use their own accessibility guidance.\n\nThe top navigation forms an app's main navigation. Therefore, it always appears at the start of a page's tab index. It also uses a `navigation` landmark to allow quick navigation from anywhere within a page's content.\n\nThe top navigation content uses logical tabbing order to move between the focusable elements.\n\nThe order that the top navigation's internal elements follow is:\n\n1. App title (homepage)\n2. Search bar\n3. First icon button\n4. Second icon button\n5. Third icon button\n6. First tab\n7. Second tab\n8. Third tab\n9. Fourth tab\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={topNavFig11}\n  imageAlt=\"An example top navigation that displays the tab order of its internal elements.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Tab ordering of the top navigation's internal elements.\"\n/>\n\n## For Assistive Technology\n\nThe secondary links and icon buttons have accessible labels that are announced by a screen reader when focused.\n\nOn smaller screens, the drawer menu acts modally and captures focus within its elements until the menu is closed.\n\nCollapsible groups in the drawer menu use `aria-expanded` to indicate whether the group is open or closed.\n\n## Based on\n\nThe top navigation component has been based on the following resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ic-link\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/landmarks/navigation.html\"\n      rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n    >\n      Navigation Landmark\n    </ic-link>\n    , W3, accessed July 2022.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Testing\n\nWe've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. It's been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.\n",

Use it for apps with complex page structures where every page should be accessible from any other page using the mega-menu.\n\nUse top navigation alongside additional components like [page headers](/components/page-header) to create a variety of different [layout](/styles/layout-spacing) and navigation styles.\n\n## When not to use\n\nFor apps with a small number of pages, use [side navigation](/components/side-navigation) as it's better suited for providing quick access and maximising the screen space for page content.\n\nUse either top navigation or side navigation. Don't use both at the same time.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={topNavFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"An example app that shows a top navigation and side navigation used on the same page.\"\n  state=\"bad\"\n  caption=\"Don't use both top navigation and side navigation at the same time.\"\n/>\n\n## Optional elements\n\n### Search bar\n\nInclude an optional [search bar](/components/search-bar) to provide search functionality on every page in the app.\n\n### Secondary links\n\nInclude secondary links or actions that appear on the right-hand side of the top navigation. Use these for global utilities like application settings, or as links to other related sites.\n\n### App status and version\n\nUse the title adornment and app version to display the app's info in the top navigation.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={topNavFig2}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of top navigation with a search bar included as well as secondary links and app status and version information.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"Top navigation with search bar, secondary links and app status and version.\"\n/>\n\n## Interaction behaviour\n\nWhen using a top navigation with mega-menu, the menu is displayed when hovering over, or focusing on, the main navigation groups.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={topNavFig3}\n  imageAlt=\"An example top navigation with mega-menu showing the mega-menu appearing when the user hovers over a navigation group in the top navigation component.\"\n  state=\"good\"\n  caption=\"A mega-menu is displayed when hovering or focusing on the top navigation's main groups.\"\n/>\n\nOn smaller screens, both top navigation variants will display a menu button that opens a drawer menu from the right-hand side of the screen.

The element to be styled should be wrapped with the typography component.\n\nThe typography variants are defined on the [typography styles](/styles/typography) page.\n\nUse one of the typography component's variants to style an element. For example, the following uses a `h2` variant to wrap a `h5` element and apply the 'heading large' styling.\n\n<ComponentPreview>\n  <IcTypography variant=\"h2\">\n    <h5>&lt;h5&gt; with 'heading large' styling</h5>\n  </IcTypography>\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n## When to use\n\nUse typography to provide consistent styling across an app's text content.\n\nUse the logical order of `h#` tags in code for headings. For example, a `h3` heading needs to come after a `h2` heading but can be styled as any variant.\n\nAdd a variant to the typography element to change its style. This doesn't change the semantic level of the typography element so make sure to always adhere to <ic-link target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/\" rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\">accessible heading levels</ic-link>. For example, body text with a variant of `h2` will appear visually as an `h2` but still be body text in the DOM.\n\n## Vertical margins\n\nWhen using a typography component within page content, apply the vertical margins to evenly space out text elements on the page.\n\nIf using the typography component within other components or compact layouts, don't apply vertical margins. You can then position the typography component with precision.\n",

We\n  needed both flexibility and solid accessibility to{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/28/podcast-gov-uk-design-system/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    unlock efficiencies\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  at speed.\n</p>\n\nWe’re passionate about making sure that everyone can contribute equitably to our shared missions. We believe our Design System is the best way to help our teams and partners do that.\n\n## Changing a culture\n\nBuilding our own Design System and UI Kit allows our teams and partners to join us on this journey. It’s key for our growth that they have a deep understanding of accessibility and good design practice.\n\nWe need teams to understand the value of consistent, usable and accessible design. To achieve this across departments, platforms, technologies and skill level requires a collaborative and community-driven approach.\n\n## Game-changing potential\n\nFaster capability development benefits everyone. The Design System has already proven that we can simultaneously speed up and improve the quality of what we build. This means the community and assets we adopt can better serve our fast-changing mission needs and we can be confident in them being accessible.\n\n## This is for everyone\n\nThe complexity of the capabilities in use is high and user needs are often open-ended and require a high level of skill. The key value delivered by our Design System is repeatable patterns across a huge number of diverse but interconnected systems.\n\nInclusion and accessibility are core to our Design System. We’ve put a lot of effort into the atomic design components (such as typography and buttons) to instil confidence in the control of our ecosystem as we learn more about the vast use cases we encounter.\n\n## What now?\n\nWe’re interested to see the potential of our work and where it can go now, sharing it with more and more people. Open sourcing is a big step, and opportunity, for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ.\n\nWe hope our experiences can support your efforts in improving accessibility and usability of complex government, enterprise and specialist technology.\n\nWe want our Design System to continue to evolve and we’re excited to see what happens next.\n\n**- The IC Design System team from MI6, MI5, GCHQ and partners.**\n",

This is due to the time and resources needed to implement these features, which are usually accomplished by large, dedicated teams in other libraries. For the ICDS, our team is small and our time spent delivering other useful features requested by the community.\n\nIn order to not leave consumers without the features they require while we implement them into our component library, we are offering a custom-made ICDS theme.\n\n<p>\n  This theme is being implemented on the{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.ag-grid.com/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    ag-grid component\n  </ic-link>\n  , which is our recommended alternative data table solution whilst we take the time\n  to implement the features our users require in a structured manner, to deliver\n  the quality product our users expect.\n</p>\n\n## Example theme\n\n<ComponentPreview>\n  <div className=\"ag-theme-icds\" style={{ height: 500 }}>\n    <AgGridReact\n      rowData={rowData}\n      columnDefs={colDefs}\n      rowSelection={{ mode: \"multiRow\" }}\n      pagination\n    />\n  </div>\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n## How to apply the theme\n\nThe theme is held in a css file exported in our `@ukic/web-components` package. To apply it, add the following class to the parent `<div>` of the ag-grid component.\n\n```jsx\n// Can either import the css directly into the component file...\nimport \"@ukic/web-components/dist/core/ag-theme-icds.css\";\n// ...or via another css file\nimport \"./{FILE_NAME}.css\";\n\nreturn <div className=\"ag-theme-icds\" style={{ height: 500 }}></div>;\n```\n\nIf importing via another css file, add the following import to the top of the file.\n\n```css\n@import \"@ukic/web-components/dist/core/ag-theme-icds.css\";\n```\n",

Breaking changes are communicated to the community as early as possible to allow teams to plan when to integrate the new packages into their projects. Major releases are very infrequent, with at least a year between them.\r\n\r\n**Minor releases** contain new component features. Minor releases are backwards-compatible with no requirement for the developer to make updates to their existing implementation. However, to use the new feature, the implementation will require a small update (such as adding a new prop) in order to use the new component application programming interface (API).\r\n\r\n**Patch releases** contain bug fixes.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Minor and/or patch releases are scheduled every two weeks. All changes to the\r\n  component library are recorded in the{\" \"}\r\n  <ic-link\r\n    target=\"_blank\"\r\n    href=\"https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit/blob/main/packages/web-components/CHANGELOG.md\"\r\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\r\n  >\r\n    Web Components CHANGELOG.md\r\n  </ic-link>\r\n  .\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nAll packages are published with identical version numbers.\r\n\r\n## How we manage Beta components\r\n\r\nBeta components are an intermediate stage in our versioning system, between the initial \"Alpha\" testing phase (peer review) and the stable release.\r\n\r\nWhen a component reaches the Beta stage, it has passed the preliminary phase but is not yet deemed fully stable. This allows us to release components for wider testing and gather feedback from our user community while further fine-tuning their functionalities and addressing potential issues.\r\n\r\nBeta components are integrated into our normal `@ukic/` packages and can be installed just like any other stable component. They are easily accessible to developers and users who wish to explore the latest developments and contribute to the improvements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to be aware of a few points when working with Beta components:\r\n\r\n1. **Potential API changes:** As Beta components are still in development, there may be changes to their API between major version updates. This could require manual adjustments in the codebase to accommodate the changes.\r\n2. **Presence of bugs:** Beta components may contain bugs or missing features.\r\n3. **Potential future major changes:** Since Beta components are actively evolving, there may be major behind-the-scenes changes planned for the future.\r\n\r\nWe consider Beta components acceptable for use in production-ready applications, as long as customers are happy with the issues mentioned previously.\r\n\r\nWe regularly review the stability and reliability of Beta components. When the component meets the criteria it can be transitioned to a stable release.\r\n\r\n## Canary components\r\n\r\nCanary components are unstable components that are released for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nThese components should not be used in production apps without understanding the risk that changes may occur in order to fix bugs or improve functionality.\r\n\r\nWe consider a Canary component to be acceptable for moving to Beta once customers have tested its usage and provided enough feedback to suggest they're happy with it.\r\n\r\nCanary components can be installed in the same way as our core `@ukic/` packages, but prefixed with canary, for example `@ukic/canary-react` or `@ukic/canary-web-components`.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n// Canary Web Components\r\nnpm i @ukic/canary-web-components @ukic/fonts\r\n\r\n// Canary React\r\nnpm i @ukic/canary-react @ukic/fonts\r\n```\r\n\r\nA difference between our Canary packages and our core `@ukic/` packages is that canary package versions follow a `<version>-canary.<build-number>` pattern.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Another difference is that docs for canary components won't appear in the\r\n  Components guidance section of this site.

DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'. The light DOM represents the structure\n  of a webpage as a tree, where each DOM object is a node.\n</p>\n\nAt the core, the UI Kit components are based off the web components specification, which utilises the shadow DOM. This makes it possible to encapsulate each component’s markup structure, styling and functionality.\n\n<p>\n  According to{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Mozilla\n  </ic-link>\n  , the \"shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular\n  DOM tree — this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, underneath which you\n  can attach any element, in the same way as the normal DOM.\"\n</p>\n\nTherefore, testing components within the shadow DOM can be problematic because elements inside a shadow root technically do not exist in the main DOM, and can prevent testing frameworks from selecting internal elements.\n\n## Testing the components\n\nTo ease the process of testing, here are guides to testing our UI Kit components in different testing frameworks.\n\n- [Jest and React Testing Library](/get-started/test-components/testing-with-jest-and-rtl)\n- [Cypress](/get-started/test-components/testing-with-cypress)\n",

Component tests are normally located adjacent to the component they are testing and are rendered on a development server.\n\n```tsx\n// Textfield.tsx\nimport { IcTextField, IcButton } from \"@ukic/react\";\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Textfield() {\n  const [favouriteCoffee, setFavouriteCoffee] = useState<String>(\"\");\n\n  const handleChange = (event) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    setFavouriteCoffee(event.detail.value);\n  };\n\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log(\"This is the best coffee going:\", favouriteCoffee);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <IcTextField\n        label=\"What is your favourite coffee?\"\n        placeholder=\"Placeholder\"\n        helperText=\"Such as Arabica, Robusta or Liberica\"\n        onIcChange={(ev) => handleChange(ev)}\n      />\n\n      <IcButton variant=\"primary\" onClick={() => handleClick()}>\n        Send\n      </IcButton>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Textfield;\n```\n\n```tsx\n// Textfield.cy.tsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Textfield from \"./Textfield.tsx\";\n\ndescribe(\"<Textfield />\", () => {\n  it(\"renders\", () => {\n    cy.mount(<Textfield />).should(\"have.property\", \"component\");\n  });\n  it(\"takes a value in the textfield and prints to console when the button is clicked\", () => {\n    // Render the component\n    cy.mount(<Textfield />);\n    // Capture the log to check later\n    cy.stub(window.console, \"log\").as(\"consoleLog\");\n\n    // Check the IcComponents have finished rendering\n    cy.get(\"ic-text-field\").should(\"have.class\", \"hydrated\");\n    cy.get(\"ic-button\").should(\"have.class\", \"hydrated\");\n\n    // Interact with the components and provide assertions\n    cy.get(\"#ic-text-field-input-1\").type(\"Black\");\n    cy.get(\"ic-button\").click();\n    cy.get(\"@consoleLog\").should(\n      \"be.calledWith\",\n      \"This is the best coffee going:\",\n      \"Black\"\n    );\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Example: End-to-end testing\n\nBelow is an example of end-to-end tests written against a ‘test app’ that has been created using ICDS components.\n\n<ComponentTesting\n  snippetArray={snippetArray}\n  showStackblitzBtn\n  stackblitzButtonTestAppProps={stackblitzProps}\n/>\n",

Further instructions on how to set up Jest for TypeScript\n  can be found on their{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    'Getting Started'\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  page.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  More information on setting up Jest can be found on{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Jest’s Getting Started page\n  </ic-link>\n  .\n</p>\n\n## Testing with React components\n\nThe `@ukic/react` package will need to be transformed before you can use these components in Jest tests.\n\nAdd a `transformIgnorePatterns` field with the value `[\"/node_modules/(?!@ukic/react)\"]` to your Jest config.\n\n## About React Testing Library\n\n<p>\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    React Testing Library (RTL)\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  provides a set of utility functions, which interrogate the DOM tree, in order\n  to build maintainable React tests. The recommended approach with RTL is to\n  test React components based on how the users view the components rather than\n  the implementation of the component. For example, a user wouldview a button by\n  the label 'Add', so the library provides a method called{\" \"}\n  <code style={{ backgroundColor: \"#EEEFF0\" }}>getByText()</code> to facilitate\n  that.\n</p>\n\n## Shadow DOM Testing Library\n\n<p>\n  It is not possible to exclusively use RTL to test{\" \"}\n  <code style={{ backgroundColor: \"#EEEFF0\" }}>@ukic/react</code> components as\n  they are React-wrapped web components, which use the{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    shadow DOM\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  (<code style={{ backgroundColor: \"#EEEFF0\" }}>&lt;ShadowRoot&gt;</code>). RTL\n  does not provide utility functions that traverse beyond the shadow DOM. With\n  the addition of{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/KonnorRogers/shadow-dom-testing-library\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Shadow DOM Testing Library\n  </ic-link>\n  , elements within the shadow DOM can be selected and then interacted with by using\n  methods provided by RTL. Shadow DOM Testing Library provides functions with 'Shadow'\n  prefixed to the query type (for example, <code\n    style={{ backgroundColor: \"#EEEFF0\" }}\n  >\n    getByShadowText()\n  </code>).\n</p>\n\n```tsx\n// DOM tree for IcAlert.\n<ic-alert class=\"dark hydrated\" message=\"Foo\" role=\"alert\">\n  <ShadowRoot>\n    ...\n    <ic-typography class=\"ic-typography-body hydrated\">\n      <ShadowRoot>\n        <slot />\n      </ShadowRoot>\n      Foo\n    </ic-typography>\n    ...\n  </ShadowRoot>\n</ic-alert>\n```\n\n## Example: Testing multiple components\n\nBelow is an example of testing `@ukic/react` components within an ICDS ‘test app’ using RTL, Jest and Shadow DOM Testing Library.\n\n<ComponentTesting\n  snippetArray={snippetArray}\n  showStackblitzBtn\n  stackblitzButtonTestAppProps={stackblitzProps}\n/>\n",

Search your intranet or contact your IT Service Desk if you're using an offline system.\n\n## How accessible this app is\n\nWe are confident that this app is accessible.\n\n### Images and diagrams\n\nThe Design System relies on images and diagrams to describe how designs and UI components should look. Some users may find limited value in the 'alt' (or alternative) text that we've been able to provide for these images.\n\nThis is especially true if the alternative text is describing colour or layout.\n\nSome images and diagrams in the Design System purposefully show 'bad' or 'non-accessible' examples of designs or UI components.\n\n## Reporting accessibility problems with this app\n\nWe're always looking to improve the accessibility of the Design System. If you find any problems not listed in this Statement or think we're not meeting your needs or the needs of others, consider contacting us using the details below.\n\n## Enforcement procedure\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations').\n\nThe responsible organisation for the Design System is SIS.\n\nIf you aren't satisfied with the accessibility of this app, consider contacting us using the details below.\n\nIf you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).\n\n## Contacting us\n\nUnfortunately, it can be hard to contact any one of the Intelligence Community organisations (SIS, GCHQ and MI5).\n\nThere are a few ways you can contact us, and we're trying to make it easier. You can contact us using:\n\n- [Raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/issues).\n- Internal teams can use the service desk if they prefer and we'll add the issue to GitHub.\n- Write to P.O. Box 1300, London SE1 1BD, marking your envelope ‘ICDS Website Accessibility’.\n\nIt isn't possible to visit us in person.\n\n## Technical information about this app's accessibility\n\nSIS is committed to making this app accessible, in accordance with the [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made).\n\n### Compliance status\n\nThis app is fully compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard.\n\n### How we tested this app\n\nThis app was last tested on 17 January 2024. The testing was carried out by Accessibility Specialists from SIS and [GCHQ](https://gchq.gov.uk).\n\nWe tested all types of pages within the app, including documentation and component pages.\n\nWe tested:\n\n- Our website at https://design.sis.gov.uk.\n- Each of the published ICDS Components.\n\nYou can read the <a href=\"/icds-accessibility-conformance-report-17-01-24.docx\" target=\"_blank\">full accessibility test report</a>. This report is called an 'Accessibility Conformance Report'. It's created by filling in a 'Voluntary Product Accessibility Template ®' (VPAT). The VPAT tests if the app complies with WCAG 2.2 criteria.\n\n## Non-accessible content\n\nThe content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.\n\n### Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations\n\nSome images and diagrams in the Design System purposefully show 'bad' or 'non-accessible' examples of designs or UI components. Because they are core to the service that the Design System is providing, they are exempt from the accessibility regulations.\n\n## Disproportionate burden\n\nWe aren't claiming a disproportionate burden to making any part of the Design System compliant to the accessibility regulations.\n\n## What we're doing to improve accessibility\n\nWe make sure any new features and content added to the Design System are compliant with the accessibility regulations. All new features are tested against WCAG 2.2 Level AA criteria.\n\nWe do this through a combination of manual browser tests, screen reader tests and automated build-time testing.\n\n## Preparation of this accessibility statement\n\nThis statement was prepared on 26 March 2021. It was last updated on 18 January 2024.\n\nThis app was last tested on 17 January 2024. The testing was carried out by Accessibility Specialists from SIS and GCHQ.\n\nYou can read the <a href=\"/icds-accessibility-conformance-report-17-01-24.docx\" target=\"_blank\">full accessibility test report</a>.\n",

That means we may need to collect some personal data from them.\n\nThe Design System is run by SIS, MI5 and GCHQ, but SIS is the responsible entity for the website.\n\n[Read SIS's entry in the Data Protection Public Register for accurate contact details](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZA455227).\n\n## What data we collect on the Design System\n\n### Contributing on GitHub\n\nIf you choose to contribute to the Design System using your GitHub account, you will associate your GitHub identity with us.\n\nWhen you contribute, the data we might therefore collect includes:\n\n- Your name.\n- User profile on GitHub and associated tools and platforms.\n\nIf you choose to submit a 'pull request' (code contribution) to the Design System using your GitHub account, you will be asked to sign our Contributor's License Agreement.\n\nWhere you provide consent, the data we collect includes:\n\n- Your name.\n- Your email address.\n- User profile on GitHub and associated tools and platforms.\n- Your consent to be contacted (or not) for career opportunities.\n- Your consent to be contacted (or not) regarding a token of gratitude.\n\nFor more information, [please read GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).\n\n## How long we keep your data\n\nWe will only keep your personal data for as long as:\n\n- The law requires us to.\n- We need for the purposes listed above.\n\n## Providers we use\n\nSIS does not store your personal data we collect on our own services.

Please check your connection or contact your local IT Service Desk.\"\n    variant=\"error\"\n  />\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n### Dialogs and modals\n\nUse dialogs for critical problems where you need to preserve information on the page.\n\nFor example, for a network problem when trying to save information and to prevent interaction with the rest of the app.\n\n### Full page\n\nUse full-page errors for the most critical problems, especially those that can't be resolved.\n\nFor example, use a full-page error message when content is missing or when the app fails to load.\n\n<ComponentPreview noPadding left>\n  <div style={{ padding: \"2.25rem\" }}>\n    <IcTypography variant=\"h1\" component=\"h3\" applyVerticalMargins>\n      LATTE STREET is unavailable\n    </IcTypography>\n    <IcTypography variant=\"body\" applyVerticalMargins>\n      This app is currently unavailable whilst we carry out an update.\n    </IcTypography>\n    <IcTypography variant=\"caption\">\n      Please check the <IcLink href=\"#\">downtime calendar</IcLink> and try again\n      later.\n    </IcTypography>\n  </div>\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n### Persistent banner\n\nUse a persistent banner at the top of an app experiencing a system or data problem. If multiple problems exist, group them into one banner.\n\nLink to available support pages and provide resolution information (if available) to provide assurance and transparency to your users.\n\nBe careful to keep persistent banners visually distinct when used alongside classification banners.\n\n### Email\n\nUse an email to notify users of a system being down, including for scheduled maintenance.\n\n### Tone of voice\n\nWrite your error message with short, jargon-free language to inform your users and consider that errors can increase anxiety for people. An error shouldn't blame the user.\n\nUse words that describe the cause of the error and, where possible, give the user a way to resolve it.\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen building or using this pattern:\n\n- Make sure components for app errors are announced to screen readers and other assistive technology.\n- Don't use colour on its own to convey the app error. Always include text or iconography.\n- Consider that errors can increase anxiety for people. An error shouldn't blame the user.\n",

[Side navigation](/components/side-navigation)\n- [Section container](/components/section-container)\n- [Footer](/components/footer)\n- [Classification banner](/components/classification-banner)\n\nWith options for:\n\n- [Page header](/components/page-header)\n- [Back to top](/components/back-to-top)\n\n## When to use\n\nWhen choosing a layout pattern, make sure it works for all pages within your app and avoid switching layout patterns on different pages.\n\nUse the side navigation layout to help provide more screen space for the main content. Side navigation is well suited to apps that have mutually exclusive features that need to be switched between easily from any page. For example, email providers often use side navigation to provide maximum screen space for email content whilst allowing constant access to other pages.\n\n## When not to use\n\nFor intranet-style and content-heavy apps, use the top navigation layout as it's better suited for providing links to a large number of pages.\n\nUse either the top navigation layout or the side navigation layout. Don't use both at the same time.\n\n## Implementation\n\nMake sure the pattern always fits the entire viewport and is never within another page container. The pattern content will adapt responsively when the viewport changes.\n\nAlways place the footer at the bottom of the page and below the fold, meaning users should scroll to see it.\n\n## Variants\n\nUse the side navigation layout with additional components including page header to create other common layouts.\n\n### Page header\n\nUse a page header to display an introduction to the content of the page. Add additional elements to provide actions, navigation or inputs at the page level.\n\nFor more information, see the [page header component](/components/page-header).\n\nexport const

pattern can be themed to change the look and feel of the app. Use the [custom theme](/get-started/install-components/custom-theme) guidance to change your app's theme. Make sure to select your theme in line with the accessibility requirements around colour contrast.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={sideNavigationPatternFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"An example page showing the layout with an alternatively themed look.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"An example of the side navigation layout themed to an alternative colour.\"\n/>\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen configuring a page make sure to follow all [accessibility guidance](/accessibility). Most accessibility requirements are covered by the individual components. For further accessibility information see the individual component pages.\n\nWe’ve tested this pattern against WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It’s been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.\n\n## Related patterns\n\n- [Top navigation layout](/patterns/navigation-patterns/top-navigation-layout)\n",

Don't add success validation to every text field.\n\nDon't use full-page success messages. If a form is submitted successfully, consider a success alert component on the subsequent screen.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Toasts\n\nUse a [toast](/components/toast) to deliver a passive success message. Use a snackbar when you don't need to guarantee a user will notice the message.\n\n### Alerts\n\nUse alerts to give feedback after a significant task. Alerts are more likely to be noticed by users.\n\nFor example, use a success alert on a subsequent page after submitting a request to give the user a reference number.\n\n<ComponentPreview icds>\n  <IcAlert\n    heading=\"Application submitted\"\n    message=\"Your application for 'additional coffee allowance' was submitted successfully.\"\n    variant=\"success\"\n  />\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n### Summary and 'review' pages\n\nOnly use a summary page after submitting a form if you need the user to export the information.\n\nDon't use a full page for a success message; use a snackbar or alert on a list or homepage instead.\n\n### Text fields\n\nUse success messages on [text inputs](/components/text-field) if you need to validate information before submitting the form.\n\nUse them in situations where you need immediate feedback, such as choosing a username.\n\n<ComponentPreview icds>\n  <IcTextField\n    label=\"Username\"\n    value=\"coffeeninja005\"\n    validationStatus=\"success\"\n    validationText=\"This username is available.\"\n  />\n</ComponentPreview>\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen building or using this pattern:\n\n- Make sure components such as alerts are announced to screen readers and other assistive technology.\n- Don't use colour on its own to convey that a problem has occurred; always include text.\n",

the components:\n\n- [Top navigation](/components/top-navigation)\n- [Section container](/components/section-container)\n- [Footer](/components/footer)\n- [Classification banner](/components/classification-banner)\n\nWith options for:\n\n- [Page header](/components/page-header)\n- [Mega-menu](/components/top-navigation)\n- [Back to top](/components/back-to-top)\n\n## When to use\n\nWhen choosing a layout pattern, make sure it works for all pages within your app and avoid switching layouts on different pages.\n\nUse the top navigation layout for article pages or content-heavy apps with lots of text.\n\nUse the top navigation layout with a mega-menu for access to a large range of navigation items.\n\nUse a mega-menu for apps with complex page structures where every page should be accessible from any other page through the mega-menu. For example, department stores or supermarkets use a top navigation with mega-menu to provide access to their large number of product categories.\n\n## When not to use\n\nFor apps that require constant access to switch between pages, use side navigation as it's better suited for providing quick access and maximising the screen space for page content.\n\nUse either the top navigation layout or the side navigation layout. Don't use both at the same time.\n\n## Implementation\n\nMake sure the pattern always fits the entire viewport and is never within another page container. The pattern content will adapt responsively when the viewport changes.\n\nAlways place the footer at the bottom of the page and below the fold, meaning users should\nscroll to see it.\n\n## Variants\n\nUse the top navigation layout with additional components including page header to create other common layouts.\n\n### Page header\n\nUse a page header to display an introduction to the content of the page. Add additional elements to provide actions, navigation or inputs at the page level.\n\nFor more information, see the [page header component](/components/page-header).\n\nexport const

pattern can be themed to change the look and feel of the app. Use the [custom theme](/get-started/install-components/custom-theme) guidance to change your app's theme. Make sure to select your theme in line with the accessibility requirements around colour contrast.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={topNavigationPatternFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"An example page showing the layout with an alternatively themed look.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"An example of the top navigation layout themed to an alternative colour.\"\n/>\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen configuring a page make sure to follow all [accessibility guidance](/accessibility). Most accessibility requirements are covered by the individual components. For further accessibility information see the individual component pages.\n\nWe’ve tested this pattern against WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It’s been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.\n\n## Related patterns\n\n- [Side navigation layout](/patterns/navigation-patterns/side-navigation-layout)\n",

These colours meet or exceed all [accessibility requirements](/accessibility/requirement).\r\n\r\nThe colour styles are built into the [UI Kit](/get-started). You should use these to help maintain consistency when you are building custom experiences.\r\n\r\n## Text\r\n\r\nPrimary text is an off-black colour that satisfies minimum and maximum contrast needs. Use this colour for the majority of text and elements.\r\n\r\nUse the secondary text colour for supporting content such as helper text or less important information in lists and tables.\r\n\r\nUse the tertiary text colour for even less important information. Use the tertiary text colour sparingly and always try to use the primary or secondary colours first.\r\n\r\nDon't use different colours for text, unless specified as part of a component.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursText} />\r\n\r\n## Action\r\n\r\nUse the action colour for interactive elements like buttons, form controls and important actions. This makes it easy for people to recognise elements and switch between contexts.\r\n\r\nThe single action colour creates consistency across a range of apps. Use the dark or light action colour variant if a background colour is used.\r\n\r\nUse the destructive action colour styles for actions that can't be reversed.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursAction} />\r\n\r\n### Action backgrounds\r\n\r\nInteractive elements sometimes require transparent backgrounds for their hover and pressed states. The action background colour styles use the action colour styles with transparency.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursActionBackgrounds} />\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\nUse these colours for all links. These specific colours help to identify links from non-interactive text.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursLinks} />\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nUse these colours only for status updates, errors and warnings. Always include text describing the status even if you use an icon.\r\n\r\nUse the contrast colour variants to achieve good contrast when displaying status on dark backgrounds.\r\n\r\nUse the 'warning dark' colour for any 'warning' text.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursStatus} />\r\n\r\n## Classification\r\n\r\nUse these colour styles for components that indicate content's classification.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursClassification} />\r\n\r\n## Architectural\r\n\r\nUse these colours in lines, borders and backgrounds to logically separate distinct pieces of content.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursArchitecturalAll} />\r\n\r\n## Theme\r\n\r\nYou may choose a theme colour to give your app a distinct theme or 'brand'. Make sure it meets contrast requirements with either black or white foreground text.\r\n\r\nIf you use the [IC UI Kit](/components), the foreground colour will be automatically determined based on your theme colour.\r\n\r\nThe theme colour is used on the [top navigation](/components/top-navigation), [side navigation](/components/side-navigation), [hero](/components/hero) and [footer](/components/footer) components.\r\n\r\nDon't use theme colours on any other components.\r\n\r\n<ColorTable config={ColoursTheme} />\r\n\r\n## Accessibility considerations\r\n\r\nThese colours have been considered against a variety of accessibility and usability practices. This includes colour contrast, recognition, consistency and with various colour deficiencies.\r\n\r\nIf using a 'light' theme colour, any text in those components will need to be black instead of white. This is automatic if you're using the IC UI Kit. It's not possible to use 'inaccessible' colours in the IC UI Kit as they'll revert to the default theme colour. See the component documentation for more details.\r\n",

Components on each of these layers cast differing levels of shadow to provide the appearance of different heights from the page.\n\nThere are three layers:\n\n1. The base layer contains most of the page content and scrolls within the viewport. Its contents are on the bottom layer of an app so cast little or no shadow.\n2. The overlay layer contains components that overlay the base layer. These overlaid components may stick to the viewport when scrolled and cast a small shadow.\n3. The modal layer sits above all other content and contains components that are important to display to the user and interrupt their current task. Components on this layer cast a large shadow.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={elevationFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"A graphic of an application showing the different layers of interaction on the lef-hand side and a depth chart on the right.

It encloses most components and inherits their shapes. They are especially useful for keyboard-only and power users.\n\nWhen applied to squared components, for example [buttons](/components/button), [text field](/components/text-field) and [checkboxes](/components/checkbox), the focus indicator will fully enclose the component and therefore appear squared.\n\nWhen applied to rounded components, for example [radio](/components/radio), [switch](/components/switch) and [back to top](/components/back-to-top), the focus indicator will appear rounded.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={focusIndicatorFig1}\n    imageAlt=\"An image of a button and back to top component, both with focus applied to them.\"\n    state=\"none\"\n    caption=\"Focus indicators inherit the border radius of the components they enclose.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Links\n\nWhen links are focused, the indicator will appear as the hover state.\n\n<DoubleDoDontCaution>\n  <DoDontCaution\n    imageSrc={focusIndicatorFig2}\n    imageAlt=\"An image of a blue link labelled 'Coffee blog' with a thick underline of the same colour.\"\n    state=\"none\"\n    caption=\"Focus on links is indicated by a thick underline.\"\n  />\n</DoubleDoDontCaution>\n\n## Positioning and layout\n\n### Adjacent to components\n\nFor most components, the focus indicator will enclose the full component, appearing directly adjacent to its borders.\n\n### Internal to components\n\nFocus indicators are required to be fully visible. For components that are adjacent to other components, or the viewport edge, the focus indicator appears internal to the component to remain visible.\n\nEnough padding is provided within these components so that no content is obscured. Make sure to always confirm that no part of the focus indicator or the component's content is clipped or obscured.\n\n## Navigation\n\nKeyboard navigation controls vary between components. For specific information, refer to the 'Accessibility' tab in a component's page.\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\n<p>\n  We've designed this style token to meet the emerging{\" \"}\n  <ic-link\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/\"\n    rel=\"noreferer noopener nofollow\"\n  >\n    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Candidate Recommendation\n  </ic-link>{\" \"}\n  criteria for Level AA (and in some cases AAA) requirements.\n</p>\n\nGiven the requirements are still a draft and may be subject to change, we will track these criteria to make sure this style token remains conformant.\n",

      "contents": "\n## Abbreviations and acronyms\n\nWe regularly use abbreviations and acronyms, especially in technology. Write out the words the first time you mention it, then use the short version next time.\n\nFor example, write 'Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)' the first time you mention it. Then 'SIS' the second time.\n\n## Ampersands\n\nDon’t use ampersands in body text. “And” should be spelled out in sentences and paragraphs. Spelling out “and” improves readability and makes scanning easier. Use ampersands only if they are part of a logo or in a brand name.\n\n## Paragraphs\n\nA paragraph should be made up of two to three sentences if possible.\n\n## Capitalisation\n\nWe don't use block capitals as they're difficult for people to read.\n\nCapitalise proper nouns and write everything else in sentence case. A proper noun is often a specific place, person or thing.\n\nSentence case is where only the first letter of the first word in a sentence or phrase is capitalised. Using capital letters for special or important words can be highly subjective and can result in inconsistencies across an organisation.\n\n| **Like this...**       | **Not like this...**   |\n| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Date and time          | Date and Time          |\n| Text fields            | Text Fields            |\n| Intelligence Community | Intelligence community |\n\n## Bold\n\nOnly use bold to refer to text from interfaces in technical documentation or instructions &ndash; use bold to explain what field a user needs to fill in on a form, or which button they need to select. For example: “Select **Continue** to open the certificate window.”\n\n## Italics\n\nDo not use italics. Use ‘single quotation marks’ if referring to a document, scheme or initiative.\n\n## Underline\n\nNever use underline to emphasise your text because underline is used to indicate hyperlinks.\n\n## Full stops\n\nDon't use full stops in headings, list items (which are not full sentences), buttons or action links.\n\n## Lists\n\n- Consistent lists are easier to read and will be read properly by assistive technology. List items should end with a full stop if they are complete sentences.\n- Begin list items with a capital letter.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nDo not use footnotes on web pages. They’re designed for reference in print, not web pages. Always consider the user need first. If the information in the footnotes is important, include it in the body text. If it’s not, leave it out.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nNot all scenarios will be covered by this guidance &ndash; do what makes sense. For example, writing the number in words in the example below.\n\n| **Like this...**                                  | **Not like this...**                           |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| This API is built by a third-party.               | This API is built by a 3rd party.              |\n| Children's toys are sold at the second-hand shop. | Children's toys are sold at the 2nd-hand shop. |\n",

Even if the text isn't visible on the screen, assistive technology needs to describe the icon.\n\nUse tooltips on icons or icon buttons so that the meaning of an icon is obvious.\n\n## Slotted SVGs\n\nAdding the `slot` attribute to SVGs within a Typescript file produces an error due to slot not being a SVG prop. `<SlottedSVG>` removes this error and can be used with [native SVGs](/get-started/install-components/react/#working-with-slotted-svgs) or [Material Design Icons (MDI)](/get-started/install-components/react/#using-material-design-icons-mdi-with-slottedsvg).\n\n- [Side navigation component](/components/side-navigation/code/#with-material-design-icons-in-slottedsvg) using Material Design Icons with SlottedSVG\n",

This includes disability advisory networks, affinity groups and expertise from the UKIC.\n\n## Addressing potentially sensitive topics\n\nSome friendly terms can unintentionally exclude big groups of people.

It enables consistent positioning and sizing of all UI components to build structure into the designs, and speeds up the creation of new pages and components.\n\nColumns enable pages to be defined responsively, so that they look great on any device or screen size. Every component can be positioned across a number of columns and spacing between components is maintained through the use of gutters.\n\nUsing the eight-pixel square provides visual rhythm throughout the UI components as it allows internal elements to be consistently placed, and creates a continuous vertical flow using spacing tokens.\n\n## The eight-pixel square\n\nEvery component is created upon a grid comprising of eight-pixel squares. Each internal element uses position, sizing and padding values in multiples of eight pixels so that they align to this grid. Some smaller or more compact elements can use fractions of the eight-pixel square to achieve sizes such as four or two pixels.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"Two short forms each with a select box, text area and secondary button. All components and their internal elements align to a visible eight-pixel grid.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Components are based upon an eight-pixel grid to help drive visual consistency between them.\"\n/>\n\nSpacing tokens are used within the components to make sure they are consistent and to allow the quick update of spacing within the system by changing the token values. The spacing tokens are all multiples of the base eight-pixel grid square.\n\n| **Spacing token** | **Value** |\n| ----------------- | --------- |\n| --ic-space-xxxs   | 0.125rem  |\n| --ic-space-xxs    | 0.25rem   |\n| --ic-space-xs     | 0.5rem    |\n| --ic-space-sm     | 0.75rem   |\n| --ic-space-md     | 1rem      |\n| --ic-space-lg     | 1.5rem    |\n| --ic-space-xl     | 2rem      |\n| --ic-space-xxl    | 3rem      |\n\nElements are vertically laid out on a page also using these spacing tokens. This helps to provide vertical rhythm throughout a page’s contents and makes it easier to understand by organising the content into repeatable spacing patterns.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig2}\n  imageAlt=\"Two examples of a text article with a heading, subtitle and some paragraphs of body copy. The first example has its elements aligned to the eight pixel grid creating vertical rhythm, whereas the second example’s elements don't align to the grid and seem uneven.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Align all elements to the vertical eight-pixel grid to create vertical rhythm. The example on the right does not align to the grid and seems uneven.\"\n/>\n\n## The fluid column grid\n\nIt's important that page content is visible on any screen size. The fluid column grid helps us quickly define how content will display at different screen sizes by specifying the number of columns any given component will span horizontally.\n\nIt dictates the positioning of each individual component along with the horizontal spacing between them, as well as how they will contract and expand when the viewport is resized.\n\nThe fluid column grid is made up of three elements: margins, columns and gutters. The values for each of them can differ across different breakpoints.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig3}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of a 12-column grid applied to a viewport showing margins on the left and right and gutters in between each column.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"An example of a 12-column grid applied to a viewport showing margins on the left and right and gutters in between each column.\"\n/>\n\n### Margins\n\nThe margins are the spaces between the left and right sides of the screen and the content itself. Margins can either be fixed, or set to scale depending on the implementation of the page at a given screen size.\n\n### Gutters\n\nThe gutters are the spaces between columns. These are always equal to one another, but can be changed to increase or reduce at different screen sizes.\n\n### Columns\n\nThe columns define the area that content can be placed. The number of columns can be set differently across different screen sizes and scale in width as the viewport scales.\n\n### Breakpoints\n\nBreakpoints are defined horizontal viewport sizes that can be used to trigger changes in the values for margins, gutters and columns. This is what enables us to change how content is laid out as a screen changes in size.\n\n| **Breakpoint**    | **Number of columns** | **Gutters** | **Margins** |\n| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| xs (<=576px)      | 4(scaling)            | 8px         | 8px         |\n| sm (577–768px)    | 8(scaling)            | 16px        | 16px        |\n| md (769px–992px)  | 12(scaling)           | 16px        | 16px        |\n| lg (993px–1200px) | 12(scaling)           | 16px        | 16px        |\n| xl (>1200px)      | 12(scaling)           | 16px        | 24px        |\n\n### Max-width\n\nThe grid can be constrained to a max-width if you don’t want the grid to span the entire viewport. This can be useful for very large displays, or to maintain a good readable line length for your page’s copy.\n\nThe max-width will limit the width of your grid to the max-width value, and add scaling outer margins around the grid container.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig4}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of a viewport with a 12-column grid with a max-width set. Outer margins are applied on the left and right of the grid.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Set a max-width so that the column grid is constrained and outer margins are applied on the left and right of the viewport.\"\n/>\n\n### Laying out content using the grid\n\nPage content can be defined as spanning a number of columns, and this number of columns can change across each breakpoint.\n\nFor example, a card component may span three columns on the extra large breakpoint, but span all four columns on the extra small breakpoint.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig5}\n  imageAlt=\"An example showing lots of different pieces of content laid onto a 12-column grid. Different content spans different numbers of columns.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Lay out content by specifying how many columns it spans. Content can span different numbers of columns in order to achieve different layouts.\"\n/>\n\nNot all content has to span a number of columns, it can instead be defined as having a fixed width and simply positioned so that it is aligned with the columns.\n\nTake care when using fixed width elements so that they don't overflow the screen when it is reduced in size.\n\nContent can be added to containers so that only the container is set to span grid columns. This can be useful when trying to align content in an enclosed area.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig6}\n  imageAlt=\"An example form titled ‘Coffee survey’  laid out on a 12-column gird. It has some text elements spanning all 12 columns, a select input that spans six columns, a text area that spans 12 columns and a container that is aligned to the left column but is sized to hug three buttons that it contains.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Group components into containers so that they can be positioned separately from the grid. Instead, the container is positioned to the grid, not the container’s contents.\"\n/>\n\n### Fixed column grid alternative\n\nA fixed grid can be used instead of using the fluid grid layout defined above. Instead of the number of columns being specified, specify the fixed width of each column, and the page will include more columns as it grows in width and space becomes available. This can be useful when you are laying out content that can’t resize as the columns resize.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig7}\n  imageAlt=\"Two examples of fixed column grids. One has a viewport width of 496px and displays six columns. The second has a viewport width of 336px and displays only four columns.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"A fixed column grid includes different numbers of columns dependent on the viewport size. This is useful when you don't want content to resize.\"\n/>\n\n### Zoom\n\nWhen a page is zoomed in upon using the browser controls, the page and breakpoints will behave as if the screen size were changed. A zoom of 400% on a starting viewport that is 1280px wide is equivalent a screen that is 320px wide. This is one reason why it is really important to always specify your apps responsively so that all your content can be viewed equally by all users.\n\n## Grid influencers\n\nSometimes other page elements exist outside of the grid and influence how it is sized. Including a fixed size side navigation forces the grid to occupy the remaining available horizontal width of the viewport.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={layoutSpacingFig8}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of a viewport with a side navigation on the left-hand side and a 12-column grid filling the remaining space on the right.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Grid influencers, such as a fixed width side navigation, cause the grid to compress into the remaining available space.\"\n/>\n",

It can be especially useful for providing subtle feedback and affordance about functionality, as well as when loading data.\n\nHowever, use animation subtly and sparingly. Many people can experience side effects from excessive animation, such as headaches, eye strain and anxiety.\n\n## When to use\n\nUse motion to highlight relationships between interface elements to reinforce the flow of an app.\n\nSmall animations are valuable for providing feedback, such as showing that an action has been registered.\n\nTransitions between component states or animating how components enter or exit the page help an application to feel more fluid.\n\nHowever, most apps won't need animation or transitions other than the default ones from a component library.\n\nIf using custom motion in your app always provide a way to turn off animations.\n\n## When not to use\n\nDon't use motion or animation to add decorative or fun elements as these can be distracting and can cause people more severe side effects.\n\nDon't use motion as the only way to provide feedback, only use it to enhance information that can be understood without the motion.\n\nDon't create new animations where a standard one exists, such as a progress bar.\n\n## Motion behaviour\n\n### Transitions\n\nWhen navigating between pages, or in multi-step processes and other complex layouts, animating the transition can make it more obvious what has changed.\n\n<video\n  width=\"100%\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"A slide and fade animation used to highlight navigation through a multi-stepped process.\"\n>\n  <source src={motionVid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nIt can also help to hint towards where you've come from and where you might go based on your next navigation action.\n\n<video\n  width=\"50%\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"An expand animation helps to link the overlay to the component that it's related to. It also provides an indication to where the close button would take the user.\"\n>\n  <source src={motionVid2} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n#### Establish relationships\n\nWhen elements are displayed, they enter and exit the screen. Animating entry and exit behaviours can help to establish relationships between elements.\n\nDefining the order in which elements appear can help to afford hierarchy or importance. Grouping similar elements so that they animate in the same way can differentiate them from unrelated elements that animate differently.\n\nStarting entrance animations from specific positions can create parent/child relationships between elements.\n\n<video\n  width=\"50%\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"Entry and exit transitions can establish relationships between content before a user even reads the content.\"\n>\n  <source src={motionVid3} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n### Feedback\n\nMicro-interactions provide subtle feedback about a user interaction. Motion can be used as micro-interactions that immediately indicate that an action was recognised.\n\nThis type of motion should be quick so not to distract or delay the completion of a task, but instead aid the understanding of it.\n\nWhen elements change state, animation can help to emphasize the transformation by grabbing the user's attention.\n\n<video\n  width=\"50%\"\n  muted\n  controls\n  loop\n  title=\"Animating the transitions between component states emphasise the transition.\"\n>\n  <source src={motionVid4} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n### Loading placeholders\n\nMotion can be used to indicate that something is loading. Loading indicators use motion to provide a sense of progress. Animated placeholders, such as the skeleton loading pattern, prevent layouts from moving as elements are loaded and create a smoother experience.\n\n## Animation tokens\n\nThe UI Kit uses a set of animation tokens to consistently apply motion across its components. These tokens use a consistent set of values to achieve continuity across the site.\n\n### Duration\n\nThese tokens define how quickly an animation takes place. The 'fast' duration is often used for animations between component states. The ‘slow' duration is most often used for content changes.\n\n- Fast (100ms)\n- Slow (300ms)\n\n### Easing\n\nEasing helps to make motion feel natural. Using the easing token consistently helps to achieve continuity throughout an app. Use the easing tokens `--ic-easing-transition-fast` or `--ic-easing-transition-slow`.\n\n## Animation styles\n\nThese are the common animation styles that are used on component UI Kit.\n\n### Fade in and out\n\nFade animations change the opacity of an element and are used for quick transition between states as well as in entry and exit transitions.\n\n### Slide up, down, left and right\n\nSlide animations change the position of an element and are often used for entry and exit transitions or navigation.\n\n### Zoom in and out\n\nZoom animations change the size of an element and are often used for entry and exit transitions or micro-interactions.\n\n### Expand and shrink\n\nExpand and shrink animations change the shape of a component and are often used for entry and exit transitions.\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nNever use a full-page or parallax animation. Where possible, avoid decorative animation altogether.\n\nDon't animate the scrolling of a page other than the default browser behaviour.\n\nSome people indicate they prefer reduced motion through the prefers-reduced-motion browser setting. Your app must respect this setting.\n",

Side navigation takes up less room on data-heavy apps, but top navigation offers simpler navigation for content-based apps. Use the following templates to quickly create new pages.\n\nSide navigation is preferred for most apps as it provides more screen space for main content.\n\n## Side navigation\n\nUse the [side navigation](/components/side-navigation) layout for data-heavy apps. This template prioritises the main content area, giving it the full height and width of the viewport. The navigation items in the side navigation give access to your app’s main functions from every page.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={templatesFig1}\n  imageAlt=\"An example of an app with a side navigation and some example content laid out using a 12-column grid.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"The side navigation template is useful for data-heavy apps.\"\n/>\n\n## Top navigation\n\n[Top navigation](/components/top-navigation) works well for content-based apps, such as an intranet, blog or this Design System. The main navigation items can always be accessed at the top of the page. This layout often uses large margins to achieve a readable line-length for the page’s main content section.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={templatesFig2}\n  imageAlt=\"An example app titled ‘Java nice day’ that uses a top navigation and has some example content laid out on a 12-column grid.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"The top navigation template is useful for content-based apps.\"\n/>\n\n## Secondary navigation\n\nUse secondary navigation components within these templates to provide additional navigation within each main section of an app.\n\n### Page header\n\nA [page header](/components/page-header) can be added to any page in an app, giving it a title as well as offering secondary-navigation options through tabs or a stepper.\n\nUse [tabs](/components/tabs) to provide access to related pages where the content is mutually exclusive from one another.\n\nUse a [stepper](/components/stepper) to signpost a user through a linear series of steps to complete a process or view information in a particular order.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={templatesFig3}\n  imageAlt=\"Two examples of a side-navigation layout each with a page header. One uses a page header with tabs to provide secondary navigation.

One uses a page header with tabs to provide secondary navigation. The other uses a page header with a stepper.\"\n/>\n\n### Hero\n\nA [hero](/components/hero) can be included on homepages to signpost key links or actions in an emphasised position. Don’t use hero banners on every page though.\n\n<DoDontCaution\n  imageSrc={templatesFig4}\n  imageAlt=\"An example app using a top navigation layout with a hero banner that provides a key link titled ‘Get started’.\"\n  state=\"none\"\n  caption=\"Use top navigation and hero on a homepage to introduce the app or provide direction to a key action (such as search or get started).\"\n/>\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nWhen using these layout templates use appropriate HTML regions such as `<main>` and `<nav>`.\n\n## Related components\n\n- [Top navigation](/components/top-navigation)\n- [Side navigation](/components/side-navigation)\n- [Page header](/components/page-header)\n- [Hero](/components/hero)\n",
