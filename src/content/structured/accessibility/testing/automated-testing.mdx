## Introduction

Automated accessibility testing is a fast and repeatable way to spot some accessibility issues.
These tools can be integrated into development and deployment workflows.

Automated accessibility testing is essential but only finds between 30&ndash;50% of accessibility problems.
The [limitations of automated accessibility testing](/accessibility/testing/automated-testing-limitation) page explains why [manual testing](/accessibility/testing/manual-testing) is always required.

Use a variety of automated testing tools to capture as many accessibility issues as possible.

## Browser testing

Test web apps using tools and extensions for that browser and test in multiple browsers where possible.

You need to use at least two accessibility testing extensions because each one will highlight slightly different accessibility problems.

  . The Design System recommends:

      href="https://www.deque.com/axe/axe-for-web/"

    </ic-link>
    .

    >
      Accessibility Insights for Web

      rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
    >
      WAVE
    </ic-link>
    .
  </li>
</ul>

Most of these tools will highlight the WCAG or best practice accessibility problems on the page and tell you how to fix the issue.

Some of the tools will walk you through extra manual testing (like Accessibility Insights for Web), while others will conduct only a full automated test.

Browser tools can only check what is rendered on a web page when you run the test. To check multiple pages, dialogs or other temporary elements, trigger them before re-running the test.

## Linters

Tools called 'linters' analyse source code for a range of potential bugs. Some linters check for accessibility problems or have additional rulesets you can use.

Linters detect issues very early and can prevent certain accessibility problems from ever being implemented.

<p>
  The{" "}
  <ic-link target="" href="/components" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">
    UI Kit
  </ic-link>{" "}
  uses the ESLint accessibility plugin{" "}

    rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
  >
    eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
  </ic-link>
  . Equivalent ESLint plugins are available for Vue and Angular.

## Integration and unit testing

Integration testing is where parts of software are combined and tested together.

This is often done as part of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflow.

## End-to-end testing

End-to-end testing is where the entire app is tested from a user's perspective.

  are common tools for end-to-end testing. Both tools have axe-core wrappers:{" "}

    rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
  >

  </ic-link>
  , respectively.
</p>

Well configured end-to-end tests should also test multiple pages, dialogs and other temporary elements.
