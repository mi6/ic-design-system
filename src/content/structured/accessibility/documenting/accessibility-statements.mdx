## Introduction

All apps and services must publish an Accessibility Statement to comply with the Intelligence Community [Digital Accessibility Policy](/accessibility/requirement).

An Accessibility Statement is a clear overview of the accessibility compliance status and contact details for the team that looks after the app or service.

[Read the IC Design System's Accessibility Statement](/icds).

The statement includes how accessible an app or service is, known problems, who is responsible and how the product was tested.

The statement will evolve as the app or service changes. As accessibility problems are found and fixed, and new features are added, the statement must reflect the [Accessibility Conformance Report](/accessibility/documenting/conformance-report) and all testing results.

The statement must also link to your Accessibility Conformance Report if one is required.

## The template

To make the statement useful for everyone, follow the template and don't change the layout. Keep the existing language where applicable, write in plain English and avoid technical jargon.
