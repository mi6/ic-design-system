## Introduction

As well as thorough [accessibility testing](/accessibility/testing), comprehensive documentation is needed for an app or service to comply with the Intelligence Community [Digital Accessibility Policy](/accessibility/requirement).

All apps and services are required to regularly and transparently publish up to date versions of their documentation.

Documentation must be published internally to all potential users. For our external apps and services, documentation must be published publicly.

We use [Accessibility Statements](/accessibility/documenting/accessibility-statements) and [Accessibility Conformance Reports](/accessibility/documenting/conformance-report) to document how accessible our apps and services are.

## Accessibility Statement

An Accessibility Statement is a clear overview of the accessibility compliance status and contact details for the team that looks after the app or service.

The statement includes how accessible an app or service is, known problems, who is responsible, and how the product was tested.

The statement needs to explain known accessibility issues, how people can work around the issues and when you plan to fix them.

## Accessibility Conformance Report

An Accessibility Conformance Report is used for accurate and consistent reporting of accessibility status in apps and services.

This report checks that an app or service meets each applicable [WCAG](/accessibility/requirement/wcag) success criteria. Some apps or services might need to use a report which includes more criteria for the EN 301 549 standard.
