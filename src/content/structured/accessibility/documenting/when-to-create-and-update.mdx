## Introduction

All documentation needs to be kept up to date and represent the version of the app or service that users have, or will have, access to.

## When to create

Create the [Accessibility Statement](/accessibility/documenting/accessibility-statements) and [Accessibility Conformance Report](/accessibility/documenting/conformance-report) as early as possible. It's best to create them at the start of the project (or development).

An Accessibility Statement must always be available to users, even in a pilot or minimum viable product (MVP).

## When to update

Update the documentation during the lifecycle of the app or service. Whenever new features are added, tested and problems are found, they need to be reflected in the documentation.

Publish the documentation when it changes. The documentation must be reviewed at least every 12 months even if the app or service has not changed.

## Where to publish

Publish the Accessibility Statement for apps and services in the following places:

- As an accessible page, preferably available in the footer or navigation.
- In any substantive corporate records for each department where the app or service is available.

Departments may also require statements to be published on their Intranet.

The statement must reflect and link to the latest Accessibility Conformance Report.
