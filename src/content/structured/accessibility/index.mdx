## Our work on accessibility

MI6, MI5, GCHQ and our partners work to provide accessible, inclusive and equitable experiences for everyone who uses our apps and services.

This means making sure that what we build, buy or use empowers our teams.

We want our teams to consistently and effectively contribute to our mission, regardless of any impairments or accessibility needs they might have.

## Get started

If you create or manage apps or services for MI6, MI5, GCHQ and our partners, you have a responsibility to make sure they are inclusive and accessible.

To understand more about how we make our stuff accessible, read:

- [Why accessibility is important](/accessibility/introduction) and how it can affect our teams.
- [What our teams must do](/accessibility/requirement) to comply with our Policy and other public sector legislation.
- The types of [disabilities, impairments and neurological diversity](/accessibility/needs) to consider when creating apps and services.
- How to [code your apps and services](/accessibility/coding) so that they're accessible.
- How and when to [test how accessible](/accessibility/testing) your apps and services are.
- How and when to [document how accessible](/accessibility/documenting) your apps and services are.
