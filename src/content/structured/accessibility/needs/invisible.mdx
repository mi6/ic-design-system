## Introduction

The examples below aren't exhaustive but show some common experiences that may affect how people use apps and services.

### Stress and anxiety

Stress and anxiety disorders are a mixture of psychological problems such as frequent or excessive worry<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. It can include physical symptoms such as irritability, fatigue, restlessness and difficulty breathing.

### Epilepsy

Epilepsy is a condition that affects around one in every 100 people in the UK. When someone has epilepsy, it means they tend to have epileptic seizures<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.

Triggers aren't the same for everyone, but common triggers include temperature, light, stress, tiredness, flicker and computer screens.

### Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalopathy (ME)

### Fibromyalgia

Also called Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body.

As well as widespread pain, people with FMS can also experience increased sensitivity to pain, extreme tiredness, muscle stiffness, difficulty sleeping, problems with mental processes (known as "fibro-fog") such as problems with memory and concentration, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)<sup id="ref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.

## Making things accessible

In addressing some of the design issues below, we make it easier for everyone to use our apps. Thinking about the [design considerations for neurodiversity](/accessibility/needs/neurodiversity) can help people who have invisible illnesses.

### Anxiety and stress-free design

Some things we include in apps increase anxiety and for some people, the impact can be significant.

Consider:

- Error messages should explain how to fix the problem and not blame the user.
- [Motion/animation](/styles/motion) or information should only appear when the user expects it.
- Popups that disappear too quickly before they can be read, like [toasts](/components/toast).
- Use simple [layouts](/styles/layout-spacing) as complicated, dense layouts can overload users with information.
