## Introduction

People will have different degrees of a hearing impairment. Profoundly or severely deaf people may rely on hearing aids and lip-reading/speaking, whilst others will struggle with noisy environments.

A hearing impairment can include things like finding issues with background noise through to side effects of medicines.

## Examples of hearing impairments

The following table lists examples of hearing impairments in three columns (permanent, temporary and situational).

| Permanent                                     | Temporary                                                                | Situational                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Deaf (little to no hearing)                   | Ear infection                                                            | Background noise (noisy office)                   |
| Hard of hearing (mild to severe hearing loss) | Medicine side effects (such as for neonatal infections, malaria, cancer) | Noise-cancelling headphones (to counteract noise) |
|                                               | Exposure to loud noises                                                  | Poor quality audio                                |

## How to design for auditory needs

In addressing some of the design tips below, we make it easier for everyone to use our apps.

### Closed captions, subtitles and transcripts

Make sure any audio information is available in text.

For all audio content (including videos with audio) you must provide [subtitles and a transcript](/accessibility/requirement/subtitles-transcripts-captions). Subtitles must not be embedded (rendered) into the video as they need to be readable using assistive technologies.

Don't rely on automated subtitling and transcription because it might be inaccurate. Always check any automated subtitles and transcripts for accuracy.

Including closed captions and transcripts on video or audio files will make the page accessible to those with hearing impairments.

### Varying points of contact

When planning meetings, people may request multiple points of contact. For people with hearing impairments, communication via phone may not be suitable.
In these scenarios, providing multiple forms of contact will increase accessibility.

This can include interpreters for in person meetings, speech to text for virtual meetings and communication via messaging services.

### Split content

Split larger chunks into smaller sections separated by headings.
Smaller chunks are easier to read and less intensive compared to larger blocks of text.
