## Introduction

Motor impairments can fundamentally affect the usage of your app or service. Some people that use walking frames can't hold a mobile phone, and some with muscle tremors may be unable to use dropdown menus with a mouse.

There are many types and causes of motor impairments<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Over 400,000 people in the UK have rheumatoid arthritis<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> and the number of people diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2018 in the UK is around one adult in 350<sup id="ref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.

## Examples of motor impairments

The following table lists examples of motor impairments in three columns (permanent, temporary and situational).

| Permanent                                                  | Temporary   | Situational           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Missing a limb                                             | Broken limb | Holding a baby        |
| Cerebral Palsy (affects muscle tone, movement and control) | Burn        | Using a telephone     |
| Dyspraxia (co-ordination of movement)                      |             | General multi-tasking |
| Muscle tremor (inc. Parkinson's)                           |             |                       |

## Making things accessible

In addressing some of the design issues below, we make it easier for everyone to use our apps.

### Clear clickable actions

Make sure any buttons are clear and easily clickable. Buttons should be easy enough to click and shouldn't be too close together.

Avoid placing lots of actions next to each other as this could increase the risk of a user taking the wrong action.

### Design for keyboard and speech

Make sure that all functionality is accessible by keyboard only. Some users with motor impairments may not use a mouse and instead use assistive technology such as speech input.

Consider alternate input means (mouthpieces, clickers and text to speech software). Apps and services that conform to [WCAG](/accessibility/requirement/wcag) are more likely to work with assistive technologies.

For example, [Dragon speech recognition software](https://www.nuance.com/en-gb/dragon.html) allows users to navigate apps, browse desktops, open applications, type and more<sup id="ref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.
