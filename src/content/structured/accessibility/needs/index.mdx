## Types of accessibility needs

Accessibility needs can be permanent, temporary or situational. Remember to not consider those with 'accessibility needsâ€™ as a defined group of people with 'disability and impairments'.

Anyone can have a different set of needs at any time. We've curated some information to get you started, but this is by no means an exhaustive list of the types of experiences people can have.

## Government Digital Service Accessibility Personas

The GDS Accessibility team has created [seven different accessibility personas](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/).

Each persona has different access needs. They are:

- [Claudia](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/claudia/) - a sight impaired screen magnifier user.
- [Ashleigh](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/ashleigh/) - a severely sight impaired screenreader user.
- [Ron](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/ron/) - an older user with multiple needs.
- [Chris](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/chris/) - a user with rheumatoid arthritis.
- [Pawel](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/pawel/) - a user with Aspergers.
- [Simone](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/simone/) - a dyslexic user.
- [Saleem](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/saleem/) - a profoundly deaf user.
