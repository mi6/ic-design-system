## Introduction

The terms neurodiversity, neurodifference and cognitive impairment cover a broad range of impairments or differences.

Neurodiversity and neurodifference are umbrella terms referring to a group of conditions that share common features. These features often centre around differences in how people learn and process information.

People with neurodiversity often describe themselves as having a different set of skills, abilities and ways of seeing the world.

## Types of neurodiversity

Improving a design for one set of needs often improves the experiences for other groups. It's quite common that some types of neurodiversity share needs with others.

It's important to remember that neurodiversity isn't always a disability or impairment. Neurodiverse people might not identify as having accessibility needs, but will still benefit from support and accessibility considerations.

Not all types of neurodiversity and cognitive needs are included in these examples.

### Dyslexia

People with Dyslexia may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact other areas such as organisational skills.

6.3 million people (around 10% of the UK population) have dyslexia.

### Dyspraxia/Developmental Coordination Disorder

Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, is a common disorder affecting fine and/or gross motor coordination in children and adults.

Many non-motor difficulties may also be experienced. These include memory, perception and processing as well as additional problems with planning, organising and carrying out movements in the right order in everyday situations.

### Dyscalculia

Dyscalculia affects someone's ability to understand, recall or use numerical information. Some people may feel anxious when having to undertake any mathematical tasks.

Dyscalculia can also affect how numerical information is processed; some people can also have difficulty with memory, speed of thinking, organisation and sequencing. People with dyscalculia may not understand numerical references such as percentages.

### Irlen Syndrome

Irlen Syndrome is a perceptual processing disorder. It can affect what words and letters look like, including how well someone can read. It's distinct from dyslexia.

It can be the cause of unexplained symptoms such as headaches, eye strain and fatigue.

### Attention Deficit conditions

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) leads to difficulties in maintaining attention as well as impulsive and hyperactive behaviour.

The effects on people can include, but aren't limited to:

- Trouble holding attention on tasks.
- Avoidance or dislike of tasks that require a lot of mental effort.
- Forgetfulness.
- Trouble organising tasks and activities.

### Spectrum conditions (including Autism and Asperger's)

Autism (including Asperger's) is a spectrum condition that affects the way someone sees the world, processes information and interacts with others.

In the workplace, even when their qualifications and skill levels are ideally suited to the work concerned, someone may experience difficulties interacting with colleagues, and this can affect their ability to remain in employment. These may include:

- Not understanding abstract concepts.
- Needing extra time to process information or answer questions.
- Over- or under-sensitivity to light and sound.

Around 700,000 people in the UK are on the autistic spectrum. Only 16% of people with autism in the UK are in full time paid employment.

## How to design for neurodiversity

In addressing some of the design tips below, we make it easier for everyone to use our apps.

### Use colour properly

Some people understand colour differently or may not be able to infer a relationship between colour and meaning.

Always use [accessible colour](/styles/colour) and never rely on colour alone to convey meaning.

### Use graphics alongside text

Some people find it easier to look at images. Use graphs, icons and colour alongside text to provide a different way to consume information.

All images and icons must use [accessible colour](/styles/colour) and have `alt` (alternate) text and captions.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={neurodiversityAccessibilityFig14}
    imageAlt="A graphic of a survey regarding eye colour. Results are conveyed by short lines of text and by a pie chart that displays the results in a more visible solution."
    state="good"
    caption="Using both images and text can make it easier to understand data."
  />
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={neurodiversityAccessibilityFig15}
    imageAlt="A graphic of a survey regarding eye colour. Results are written in long sentences that do not show the information as clearly as possible."
    state="bad"
    caption="Using text only to present data can be complex and overwhelming."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

<IcAlert
  heading=""
  message="The pie chart in the diagram above is not a component, but shows how images should be imported. 
  Please make sure that any text in the diagram is accessible with a screen reader."
  variant="info"
/>

### Don't expect the user to remember

If you use multiple input steps, make sure you remind users what they've entered before. Don't expect people to switch (or remember) between screens to see what they typed in previously.

### Use simple words

Where possible, use [simple words](/styles/content-style/voice-and-tone) and aim for a maximum reading age of 9.
People prefer to read pages with words they are already familiar with.

### Allow browser customisations

Some people rely on Operating System or Browser settings to change the colours of their apps.
Make sure what you build can be used with platform settings.

These include Windows High Contrast mode, macOS increased contrast and browser extensions that modify CSS styles.

  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={neurodiversityAccessibilityFig16}
    imageAlt="A graphic of a dialogue box to show open-dyslexic text font, which is easier for people with dyslexia to read."
    state="good"
    caption="Open-dyslexic font is used to make text more readable for those with dyslexia."
  />
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={neurodiversityAccessibilityFig17}
    imageAlt="A graphic of a dialogue box to show default text font."
    state="bad"
    caption="Default fonts might not always benefit people with dyslexia."
  />
