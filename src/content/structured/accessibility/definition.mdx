## What accessibility means

We use the term ‘accessible’ to mean that someone isn’t excluded from something based on experiencing a disability, impairment or because they think differently.

It states that people are disabled by barriers in society rather than being disabled by a medical definition, impairment or neurodiversity they experience.

This model recognises that, with sensible consideration, we can empower people to use our technology in a way that works for them.

## There are a wide range of needs

Don't consider those with 'accessibility needs' as a defined group of people with 'disability and impairments'.

When we talk about accessible apps and services, most people think initially of visually impaired or blind users who might use screen readers.

In fact, we need to consider a lot of needs people may have, like motor impairments and neurological diversity. Good (and accessible) design considers implications of the full spectrum of diversity.

## Accessible is better for everyone

Accessible apps are always more usable for people who don't have accessibility needs. If you become skilled at considering accessibility, you'll always end up with a better product.

Something can be accessible to some people while being inaccessible to others. An app with a real-time data table might work really well for sighted users and those who use a screen reader.

However, if someone has a different reading comprehension or has anxiety from information overload, they may experience significant issues if table rows are rapidly changing or flashing.
