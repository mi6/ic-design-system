## Introduction

Use semantic HTML elements.

Most elements are semantic such as `<form>` and `<table>` which clearly define its content. However, non-semantic elements such as `<div>` and `<span>` are often overused. These don't tell us about the meaning of the content.

Using correct semantic HTML elements to make web content more accessible.

## When it goes wrong

When semantic elements aren't used, the page has no structure or definition available to assistive technologies.

Without structure or definition, to assistive technologies it's like viewing all the words on a page together in a single paragraph with the same styling, creating a wall of text.

With semantic elements assistive technologies can navigate over a page using these semantic elements, for example screen readers can jump through headings to find the section they want to read.
