## Introduction

Use semantic HTML elements.

Semantic elements, such as `<form>` and `<table>`, clearly define their content. Non-semantic elements, such as `<div>` and `<span>`, don't tell us about the meaning of their content and are often overused.

Using correct semantic HTML elements makes web content more accessible.

## When it goes wrong

When semantic elements aren't used, the page has no structure or definition available to assistive technologies.

Without structure or definition, to assistive technologies it's like viewing all the words on a page together in a single paragraph with the same styling, creating a wall of text.

With semantic elements, assistive technologies can navigate over a page using these semantic elements. For example, screen readers can jump through headings to find the section they want to read.
