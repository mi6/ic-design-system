## Introduction

Use semantic HTML elements.

Most elements are semantic such as `<form>` and `<table>` which clearly define its content. However, non-semantic elements such as `<div>` and `<span>` are often overused. These don't tell us about the meaning of the content.

Using correct semantic HTML elements to make web content more accessible.

Learn more about [HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), particularly `<nav>`, `<section>` and `role`. They're mentioned in [Document structure](/accessibility/coding/document-structure) and [Semantic layout](/accessibility/coding/semantic-layout)

## When it goes wrong

When semantic elements aren't used, the page has no structure or definition available to assistive technologies.

Without structure or definition, to assistive technologies it's like viewing all the words on a page together in a single paragraph with the same styling, creating a wall of text.

With semantic elements assistive technologies can navigate over a page using these semantic elements, for example screen readers can jump through headings to find the section they want to read.

## Best practice and WCAG

Semantic elements are mentioned in some form in most of HTML best practice articles and will help meet many WCAG success criteria.

For [1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships), semantic elements and markup are referenced in many of the sufficient techniques including:

- [G115: using semantic elements to mark up structure](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G115.html).
- [H49: using semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H49.html).

In most of the WCAG success criteria for [guideline 2.4 â€“ navigable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#navigable) semantic elements such as heading, button, link, label elements are referenced specifically or used in examples in sufficient techniques.

The sufficient technique [88: using HTML according to spec](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H88) is referenced in [4.1.1 parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#parsing) and [4.1.2 name, role, value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#name-role-value).
