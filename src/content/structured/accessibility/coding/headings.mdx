## Introduction

Use HTML headings `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>` and `<h6>` properly.

Headings are hierarchical so `<h1>` is the most important then `<h2>` through to `<h6>` being the least important. Use one `<h1>` per page.

Headings at the same level or higher start a new section, whilst headings at a lower level start a subsection. Don't skip heading levels.

If the styling of a heading doesn't look right visually, for example too big or bold, style it with CSS but always use the correct semantic heading.

The text for a heading should be descriptive, meaningful and unique on the page.

## When it goes wrong

When semantic HTML elements for headings aren't used, the page has no structure or definition available to assistive technologies.

Headings provide navigation landmarks which assistive technologies can navigate over to find the area they want on the page.

Screen readers can navigate and jump to a heading, in the same way as a sighted user would scan for the heading they need.

## Best practice and WCAG

Headings are mentioned in half of the HMTL best practice articles and will help meet five different WCAG success criteria.

[1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships) has the sufficient technique:

- [H42 using h1-h6 to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H42).
- [G141 organizing a page using headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G141.html).
- [G141](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G141.html) is also a sufficient technique for the AAA success criteria [2.4.10 section headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#section-headings).

[2.4.1 bypass blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#bypass-blocks) has the sufficient technique:

- [H69 providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H69.html)

[2.4.4 link purpose (in context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#link-purpose-in-context) has the advisory technique:

- [H80 identifying the purpose of a link using link text combined with the preceding heading element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H80.html)

[2.4.6 headings and labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels) has the sufficient technique:

- [G130 providing descriptive headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G130.html).
