## Introduction

Each page in a website should have a unique title. Make the `<title>` element as accurate and meaningful as possible.

The title appears in the browser toolbar, search-engine results and default bookmark/favourites name.

This example shows two different titles from different Design System pages:

```html
<!-- https://design.sis.gov.uk/accessibility/coding -->
<title>Coding for accessibility - Intelligence Community Design System</title>

<!-- https://design.sis.gov.uk/accessibility/coding/title -->
<title>Titles - Intelligence Community Design System</title>
```

<IcAlert
  heading="Single Page Apps (SPAs)"
  variant="warning"
  message="In single-page apps, make sure you dynamically update the page title."
/>

## When it goes wrong

If titles aren't unique and descriptive, users must read the content to understand where they are. This makes your app less usable for those using assistive technologies like screen readers.
