## Introduction

All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration above the `<html>` tag.

This tells the browser how to render the HTML, as in this example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This is the HTML5 doctype but W3C provides information on [choosing the right doctype](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Doctypes_and_markup_styles).

## When it goes wrong

If no valid `<!DOCTYPE>` is declared, the browser switches to [quirks mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode). This means it emulates non-standard behaviour of deprecated browsers.

In this case, elements from the HTML5 specification may not parse or render properly. This can cause issues for people who use assistive technologies.

## Best practice and WCAG

Declaring a doctype is mentioned in most HMTL best practice articles and will help meet WCAG success criteria [4.1.1 parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0&showtechniques=411#parsing) in the sufficient technique [G134: validating web pages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G134.html).
