## Discussing user needs

If done in the right way, having a discussion upfront about people's needs can be very valuable.

Being proactive, in a positive manner, will build up a good relationship with your users and ensure you're delivering the best experience possible.

It can be hard to know who your users are. It's important not to disregard accessibility because you 'can't find anyone with accessibility needs'.

Only test your apps with real users [when you've completed your own accessibility testing](/accessibility/testing#testing-with-real-people). This means you don't waste people's time, and you can get more valuable usability insights.

## Disclosure

Disclosing a disability or impairment is an individual decision, and there is no obligation for anybody to do so. The point at which an individual discloses a disability or impairment (if at all) varies from case to case.

There are many reasons why someone may or may not choose to disclose. Reasons for non-disclosure include a fear that it will disadvantage them if disclosed. Some may have a disability or impairment they have not yet discovered and so wouldn't know there was a need for disclosure.

There are also many reasons why disclosing a disability is a positive action that will empower, protect and assist someone in the workplace.

Awareness of someone's needs may mean that provision can be made for reasonable adjustments. The person and their colleagues may feel more comfortable to have open conversations about their requirements. This can lead to the person facing fewer barriers to employment and training opportunities.

Discussing someone's needs should be handled sensitively and on a one-to-one basis.
