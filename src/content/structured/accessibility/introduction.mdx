## Introduction

Accessibility is not just about disability; it covers a wide range of needs from temporary motor impairments and blindness, to neurological diversity like dyslexia and anxiety.

One in five people in the UK have a disability<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> and up to 15% of people are neurodiverse<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.

There are also many people who might have temporary accessibility needs and wouldn't identify as having them.

## Permanent, temporary and situational

Impairments can be permanent, temporary or situational. Anyone can have a different set of impairments at any time and those needs can change quickly.

There are no hard and fast rules about how a disability, impairment or neurological diversity affects someone.

A person born with one arm, a person with a broken wrist and a person holding a baby all have a reduced ability to interact through their hands. Each will interact with things differently; arguably, someone with one arm may be better prepared than someone with a broken wrist.

Accessibility and inclusive design isn't restricted to a small community with life-changing needs.
