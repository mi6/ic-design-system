## Introduction

Accessibility is not just about disability; it covers a wide range of needs from temporary motor impairments and blindness, to neurological diversity like dyslexia and anxiety.

There are also many people who might have temporary accessibility needs and wouldn't identify as having them.

## Permanent, temporary and situational

Impairments can be permanent, temporary or situational. Anyone can have a different set of impairments at any time and those needs can change quickly.

There are no hard and fast rules about how a disability, impairment or neurological diversity affects someone.

A person born with one arm, a person with a broken wrist and a person holding a baby all have a reduced ability to interact through their hands. Each will interact with things differently; arguably, someone with one arm may be better prepared than someone with a broken wrist.

Accessibility and inclusive design aren't restricted to a small community with life-changing needs.
