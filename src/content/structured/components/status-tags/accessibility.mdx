## Easy to use for everyone

Status tags use colours that have been designed for maximum legibility across a range of visual impairments.

## For Assistive Technology

Status tags can have `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` tags that provide additional content to the visible label. However, the visible label must be included within the accessible label.

## Based on

The status tag component has been based on the following resources:
