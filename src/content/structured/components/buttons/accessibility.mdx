## Easy to use for everyone

When interacting with a button using the keyboard, the button is triggered using the **space** or **enter** key when the button is focused.

## For Assistive Technology

Buttons use the role of `button` as opposed to `link` in order to help users of assistive technology understand that the button is performing an action on the page instead of navigating them to a new location.

## Based on

The button component is based on the following resources:

<ul>
  <li>
    <ic-link
      target="_blank"
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role"
      rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
    >
      Button role
    </ic-link>

## Testing

We've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. It's been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
