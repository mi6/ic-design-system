## Easy to use for everyone

When interacting with a button using the keyboard, the button is triggered using the **space** or **enter** key when the button is focused.

## For Assistive Technology

Buttons use the role of `button` as opposed to `link` in order to help users of assistive technology understand that the button is performing an action on the page instead of navigating them to a new location.

## Based on

The button component is based on the following resources:

- [Button role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role), MDN web docs, accessed January 2022.
- [Building Accessible Buttons with ARIA](https://www.deque.com/blog/accessible-aria-buttons/), Deque University, accessed January 2022.

## Testing

We've tested this component against WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It's been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
