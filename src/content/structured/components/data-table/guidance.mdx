## Canary components

Canary components are unstable components that are released for testing purposes.

We value any feedback from users willing to try them in their applications.

These components should not be used in production apps without understanding the risk that changes may occur in order to fix bugs or improve functionality.

For more information on canary components, read our approach to [releases and versions](/get-started/releases-versions).
