## Easy to use for everyone

Tooltips can be used by people using any input method. They display by default on hover or on focus.

To ensure the tooltip content can be understood, the tooltip remains displayed if the cursor is moved over the tooltip area, even if it leaves the associated elementâ€™s area.

The text displayed within a tooltip is selectable so that it can be copied or focused with a virtual cursor.

## For Assistive Technology

Tooltips use `aria-describedby` or `aria-labelledby` to link it with the associated element.

## Based on

The tooltip component has been based on the following resources:

## Testing

We've tested this component against WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It's been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
