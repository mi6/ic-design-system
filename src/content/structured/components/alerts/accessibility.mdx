## Easy to use for everyone

Where alerts are added to a page content, they can be tabbed to following the logical page content order.

Where both an action button and a dismiss button are included on an alert, focus is first applied to the action button and then the dismiss button.

## For Assistive Technology

Alerts use the `alert` role creating an `aria-live` region that's rendered on page load. If the alert appears on the page, it constitutes a status update. The `aria-live` region causes the alert to be brought to the attention of assistive technology users.

By default, the alert uses an `aria-live` value of `assertive` to interrupt the user flow to call attention to the status change.

If the alert content is not urgent, consider using an `aria-live` value of `polite` instead. This announces the alert contents after the current element announcement has been completed.

## Based on
