## Introduction

Alerts are displayed inline with other page content and show status depending on the severity of the message.

<ComponentPreview>
  <IcAlert
    heading="Hot drink"
    message="Please be careful, your drink will be hot."
    variant="warning"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

Alerts have six status variants:

- Neutral
- Success
- Warning
- Error
- Info
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## When to use

Use an alert to notify a user without blocking or interrupting them.

Position alerts in line with page content so that they are closely associated with the related content that follows them.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig1AlertsLight, Fig1AlertsDark]}
  imageAlt="An article titled ‘The perfect blend’ displaying a warning alert which reads ‘Take care. This article has yet to be reviewed and so may contain errors’. "
  state="good"
  caption="Use alerts in line with other associated page content. "
/>

Use alerts to:

- Summarise [form validation](/patterns/form-validation) errors.
- Inform of failures in a particular part of an app.
- Inform of a success when returning to a homepage, confirmation page or starting location.
- Make important information stand out from surrounding content.

Include a button or link within an alert to provide related interactions.

Include a dismiss button within an alert to allow the alert to be dismissed.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig2AlertsLight, Fig2AlertsDark]}
  imageAlt="An article titled ‘The perfect blend’ showing an information alert with an action button that says ‘Post comment’ and a dismiss button. The alert message says ‘This is a brand new post. Show your appreciation by leaving a comment below."
  state="good"
  caption="Include a button or link to provide actions on an alert. Use a dismiss button to allow the alert to be dismissed."
/>

## When not to use

Don’t use alerts for passive feedback on a process, for example 'draft discarded' or 'email sent'. Use [toasts](/components/toast) instead.

Don’t overlay alerts on page content. Alerts are placed inline with the rest of the page content.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig3AlertsLight, Fig3AlertsDark]}
  imageAlt="An article titled ‘The perfect blend’ with an information alert overlaid on top of the page content."
  state="bad"
  caption="Don’t use alerts positioned above/on top of page content."
/>

Use the [form validation pattern](/patterns/form-validation) for errors on a text field or in a form.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig4AlertsLight, Fig4AlertsDark]}
  imageAlt="A form titled ‘The perfect blend’ that contains 2 skeletons. A success alert shows an error message that says ‘There was an error on this page. Please fix any errors highlighted before continuing.’"
  state="bad"
  caption="Do not use an alert variant that is not related to its message."
/>

## Content

Avoid using lengthy message content in an alert. Use dialogs or a [full page error message](/patterns/form-validation) to display longer messages.

Use a title on an alert to provide a short description of the alert content.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig5AlertsLight, Fig5AlertsDark]}
  imageAlt="An image of an article titled ‘The perfect blend’ showing an info alert with a lengthy message that takes a lot of room to display among other page content."
  state="caution"
  caption="Avoid using lengthy messages within an alert."
/>

Use the default icons with success, warning, error and info alerts.

When using neutral alerts, specify an icon to be used from the [iconography guidance](/styles/icons). Always specify alt text when using any custom icon.
