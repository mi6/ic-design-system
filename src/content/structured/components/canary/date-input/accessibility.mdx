## Easy to use for everyone

### Keyboard navigation

The day, month and year values of a date input focus from left to right with focus moving between each date element.

The day, month and year values can be updated using the up and down arrow keys. For example, if hovering day input, people can use the arrow keys to increase or decrease the day.

Pressing tab and shift tab will move the cursor between day, month and year. Pressing forward slash or dash(hyphen), will move the cursor from left to right as these are commonly used date separators.

People can copy and paste into a date input component to quickly input a date into the date input field.

## For assistive technology

### Screen readers

To aid people in understanding how to navigate through a date input, the label, helper text and date input description are initially read out. The description announced for the date input includes the date format (if there is custom helper text) and how to add values using the arrow keys.

When selecting the day using the arrow keys, the day and then the phrase day for example, '01, day' is announced.

When using the arrow keys on month, the following message announcement is made, '01 - January, month'.

Using the arrow keys on year, voice over reads out year and the phrase year. For example, '2024, year'.

Once day, month and year have been set, making further updates to the input has the announcement read, 'Selected date: _date changed to_'. For example, if it was previously on 01/01/2023 and the day was updated to 02, it will announce, 'Selected date: Monday 2, January 2023'.
