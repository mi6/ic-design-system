## When to use

Use a date picker to select an event that is near to the present time.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={figure1}
  imageAlt="A date picker being used to select a nearby date"
  caption="Use date picker to visualise and select dates"
/>

Use a date picker to select a date that is known or desired, such as an appointment.

Use a date picker to select a single date where visualising that date could be useful.

Use a date picker to select a single date that is not commonly known, such as a meeting date.

Use a date picker when there is a need to view a date in context. For example, if there is a need to see which day of the week a future event occurs.

## When not to use

Avoid using a date picker for well-known dates, such as dates of birth, because it is often easier to type this into a field. For example, if selecting 30/07/1966, consider using [date input](/components/canary/date-input) as a date picker would require many clicks to arrive at the same date.

## Sizing

Use the date picker size properties to change its vertical size and achieve compact or spacious layouts.

### Width

Use the resizing options to increase or decrease width to match other elements in a form.

Use the [date input](/components/canary/date-input) resizing options to change size of the input and calendar between minimum and maximum widths. For example, to create a larger date picker, resize width of [date input](/components/canary/date-input).

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={figure3}
  imageAlt="Two date picker examples at their maximum and minimum width"
  caption="Change the width of the date input to adjust the date picker width."

## Content

### Labels and helper text

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={figure4}
  imageAlt="A date picker field with label, helper and placeholder text highlighted."
  caption="Labels, helper text and placeholder text make up the instructional elements of an input."
/>

Refer to [typography styling](/styles/typography#text) for correct label, error text and helper text styles.

### Labels

Use [content styling](/styles/content-style/principles) for help with building effective labels for people using date input.

### Helper text

Use helper text to indicate restrictions in your date input such as not allowing weekends.

### Placeholder

Use a placeholder to demonstrate an example of the desired input. Do not add essential information into the placeholder as it will be hidden when a date is entered into the field.

## Interaction

Set `open-at-date` to specify the date in view when the date picker is opened. If no date is set, the date picker will default to showing the current date.

The [date input](/components/canary/date-input) and the date picker update according to any input made. For example, if 10/10/2100 is entered in the [date input](/components/canary/date-input), the date picker will open to display the selection.

  imageAlt="Three date pickers displaying the differing content views of day, month and year."

## Validation

### Standard

See [date input](/components/canary/date-input#validation) for detailed guidance on how to display errors within the date picker.
