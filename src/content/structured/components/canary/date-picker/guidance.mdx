## Introduction

A date picker is a type of drop-down control that allows people to easily view and select dates within the context of a week and month.

## Component Demo

<ComponentPreview>
  <IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" />
</ComponentPreview>

## When to use

Use a date picker to select an event that is near to the present time.

  state="good"
  caption="Use date picker to visualise and select nearby dates."
/>

Use a date picker to select a date that is known or desired, such as an appointment.

Use a date picker to select a single date where visualising that date could be useful.

Use a date picker to select a single date that is not commonly known, such as a meeting date.

## When not to use

Avoid using a date picker for well-known dates, such as dates of birth, because it is often easier to type this into a field. For example, if selecting 30/07/1966, consider using [date input] (../date-input/) as a date picker would require many clicks to arrive at the same date.

  state="caution"
  caption="Avoid using a date picker when dealing with distant dates."

## Sizing

Use the date picker size properties to change its vertical size and achieve compact or spacious layouts.

### width

Use the resizing options to increase or decrease width to match other elements in a form.

Use the [date input] (/components/canary/date-input) resizing options to change size of the input and calendar between minimum and maximum widths. For example, to create a larger date picker, resize width of [date input] (../components/date-input).

{" "}

<DoDontCaution
  imageAlt="Two date picker examples at their maximum and minimum width"
  state="good"
  caption="Change the width of the [date input] (../date-input) to adjust the date picker width."
/>

## Content

### Labels and helper text

{" "}

<DoDontCaution
  imageAlt="A date picker field with label, helper and placeholder text highlighted."
  caption="Labels, helper text and placeholder text make up the instructional elements of an input."
/>

Refer to [typography styling] (/styles/typography#text) for correct label, error text and helper text styles.

Use text for the date picker month selection buttons.

Use numerical values within the date picker year selection buttons.

Use helper text to indicate restrictions in the date picker. Such as not allowing future dates within a date of birth collection.

## Interaction

Use [date input] (../components/date-input) instead of a date picker, if navigating a date picker would take considerably longer.

Use a date picker when there is a need to visualise a date and the exact date is not known, such as ‘Monday two weeks from now’.

## Validation

### Standard

Use the ‘error’ errored state when a date selection would be invalid, such as a future date selection for date of birth.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    state="good"
    imageAlt="A date picker with error caused by choosing a date outside of allowed range."
    caption="Make sure to be clear and instructive when writing error messages. 
Avoid ambiguity or terms like please when writing error messages. "
  />
  <DoDontCaution
    state="bad"
    imageAlt="A date picker with error caused by choosing a date outside of allowed range."
    caption="Make sure to be clear and instructive when writing error messages. 
Avoid ambiguity or terms like please when writing error messages. "
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

Use the ‘error’ errored state when a date is valid, but outside of acceptable range. For example, selecting a date that would make you too young.

Use the ‘error’ errored state for selections you deem invalid. For example, for if weekends are an invalid selection date, show the error state and supporting message upon user selection.

For additional errors, see [date input] (../components/date-input#validation#)
