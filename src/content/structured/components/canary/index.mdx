These pages give examples and guidance for our canary components. These components are likely to change in the future.

Our storybook gives further details on our canary components and how they can be used in your applications:

- <IcLink
    href="https://mi6.github.io/ic-ui-kit/branches/canary/date-input/canary-react/?path=/story/react-components-date-input--docs"
    target="_blank"
  >
    Date input
  </IcLink>

## Installing the components

### Step one

In the root of your project:

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/canary-react @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/canary-react @ukic/fonts
```

### Step two

Add the following into the top level CSS file for your project.

```css
@import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
@import "@ukic/canary-react/dist/core/core.css";
```

<p>
  In order to be rendered consistently across browsers and in line with modern
  standards, each of the ICDS components uses styles from a global CSS file
  based on{" "}
  <ic-link
    target="_blank"
    href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/"
    rel="noreferer noopener nofollow"
  >
    Normalize.css
  </ic-link>
  .
</p>

If you would like to import these styles to apply them to the rest of your project and slotted elements used within any of the ICDS components, add the following into the top level CSS file as well.

```css
@import "@ukic/canary-react/dist/core/normalize.css";
```

### Step three

Import the component(s) in your files.

```jsx
import { IcComponent } from "@ukic/canary-react";
```
