## Introduction

Data display components are reusable elements that visualise and present complex information in an understandable format.

These components make it easier for users to interpret trends within applications or dashboards. They act as building blocks for data-heavy applications, enabling quicker analysis.

## Components

The current data display components are:

- [Data list](/components/data-display/data-list)
- [Data table](/components/data-display/data-table)

## Contribute

We are expanding the UI Kit. If you can't find the data display component you're looking for, you can check out the [roadmap](/community/roadmap) for what's coming. If you would like to help, please read more on [how to contribute](/community).
