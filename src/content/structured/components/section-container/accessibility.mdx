## Easy to use for everyone

Section containers align content on the page, which helps to form a constant edge from which to read from. This aids swift readability as a user can scan back to the same position to start the next line of content. It supports standard reading scanning patterns by creating a consistent baseline.

The width of a section container is contrained to a maximum width on large devices in order to keep the line length to a readable size.

Consistent alignment also reduces cognitive load when trying to understand content on a page and helps to associate elements to one another through proximity and symmetry.
