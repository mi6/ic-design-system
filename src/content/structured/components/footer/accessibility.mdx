## Easy to use for everyone

The footer acts as a container for additional information and links. All footer content needs to align to that component's accessibility guidelines.

## For Assistive Technology

As above, all content of the footer should follow their relevant assistive technology guidelines.

Any logos that are included in the footer need to have alt-text assigned. The alt-text should simply be the name of the organisation or entity that the logo describes.

The footer uses the HTML footer page region to allow quick navigation between page regions when using assistive technology. It assigns the `contentinfo` ARIA landmark to adhere to proper page structure and semantics.

## Based on
