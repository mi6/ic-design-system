# Accessibility

## Easy to use for everyone

Text inputs can have `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` tags that provide additional content to the visible label.

## For Assistive Technology

Text inputs use `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-live="assertive"` for validation. Use `aria-invalid="false"` for successes or warnings and `aria-live="polite"` to announce the character count.

We have included a hidden label through `aria-describedby`, contained in a hidden span to inform the users of the maximum character count when the component is focused.

## Based on

The text input component has been based on the following resources:

## Testing

We've tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. It's been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
