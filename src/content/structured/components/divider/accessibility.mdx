## Easy to use for everyone

Horizontal dividers without a label use the semantic `<hr>` ('thematic break' or 'horizontal rule') HTML element.

Vertical dividers use the `separator` role and have an `aria-orientation` attribute set to `vertical`. Horizontal dividers with a label use the `separator` role and have an `aria-orientation` attribute set to `horizontal`. These attributes are implicitly present on horizontal dividers with no label because of the use of the `<hr>` element.

## For Assistive Technology

Labels on dividers will be announced by a screen reader when navigating with a virtual cursor.

## Based on
