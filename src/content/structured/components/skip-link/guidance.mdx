## Component variants

There are two variants of the skip link component:

- Default
- Inline

## When to use

### Default

Use the default skip link to bypass repetitive blocks of content and interface, such as page headers and top navigation, and go directly to the main content of a page.

The first focusable element on a page should be a skip link that, on activation, sets focus on the main content on the page.

  state="good"
  caption="Use the default variant to skip to the main content of a page."
/>

### Inline

Use the inline variant when you are nesting skip link in a navigational component like [tree view](/components/tree-view).

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig2InlineVariantLight, Fig2InlineVariantDark]}
  imageAlt="A skip link component appearing as the first item in a tree view"
  state="good"
  caption="Use the inline variant to nest skip link in a tree view navigational component."
/>

## Interaction behaviour

Skip links temporarily appear when they are tabbed to. They are visually hidden when they are no longer in focus. They are activated using the **Enter** key or by mouse click. On activation, a skip link should set focus on a targeted content area, for example a `<main>` element.

Avoid setting focus to the top of the body because users will have to navigate through the header and navigation.

## When not to use

Avoid using a skip link when a page has no navigation or repetitive blocks of content.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig3NoHeaderContentLight, Fig3NoHeaderContentDark]}
  imageAlt="A skip link component appearing in a page with no navigation"
  state="bad"
  caption="Don't use a skip link when there are no repetitive blocks of content or interface that need to be bypassed."
/>
