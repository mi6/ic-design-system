## Easy to use for everyone

Breadcrumbs are formed out of a set of links. Each of these links is individually focusable. The breadcrumbs form a navigation landmark with an accessible name of ‘breadcrumbs’ so that they can be easily accessed.

## For Assistive Technology

The separators between links are added programmatically so that they aren't read out by screen readers. The separators are purely decorative so don't need to be announced to the user.

## Based on

The breadcrumbs component has been based on the following resources:
