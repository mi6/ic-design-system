## Easy to use for everyone

Links use the semantic `<a>` HTML element (anchor element) with an `href` attribute, to create a hyperlink.

## For Assistive Technology

Most screen readers will announce “link” before reading out a link. For example, a link labelled “Components” will be read out as “link components”.

## Based on

The links component has been based on the following resources:

- [Links and Hypertext](https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/), WebAIM, accessed July 2022.
