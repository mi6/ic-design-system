## Canary components

Canary components are unstable components that are released for testing purposes.

We value any feedback from users willing to try them in their applications.

These components should not be used in production apps without understanding the risk that changes may occur in order to fix bugs or improve functionality.

For more information on canary components, read our approach to [releases and versions](/get-started/releases-versions).

## Introduction

Tree views allow for a large array of items to be displayed compactly, providing quick navigation throughout an application.

<ComponentPreview>
  <div style={{ width: "250px" }}>
    <IcTreeView heading="Menu">
      <IcTreeItem label="Coffee" />
      <IcTreeItem label="Tea" />
      <IcTreeItem label="Hot chocolate" />
    </IcTreeView>
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

## When to use

Use tree view to display further navigation options in the application, such as web pages following the home page.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={treeViewFig1}
    imageAlt="An example of using tree view to navigate throughout an app with nested pages."
    state="good"
    caption="Use tree view to navigate throughout hierarchical content."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

Use tree view for hierarchical navigation options, such as related subsections to the current page or topic.

Use the tree view title bar to provide further clarity on the context of your tree view items.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={treeViewFig2}
    imageAlt="An example of using tree view with a title bar to display related content."
    state="good"
    caption="Use tree view with icons and a title bar to provide context to your data."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

## When not to use

Avoid using tree view for dense or complicated data display. Consider if this could be displayed better with a [data table](/components/data-table) or a grid.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={treeViewFig3}
    imageAlt="An example of using tree view for dense data with several data types."
    state="bad"
    d
    caption="Don't use tree view for data that would benefit from being aligned vertically."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

Avoid using tree view in a drawer or section with restricted width, as the nested layers for child tree items require width to expand into.

Avoid using multiple tree views on the same web page; consider using tabs which navigate to separate sections.

## Colour

Use the dark or light theme to achieve colour contrast compliance when using tree view on different coloured backgrounds.

## Sizing and placement

Set the tree viewâ€™s vertical size dependent on the number of tree view items to be displayed. Large items take up more height so are good to use when there are fewer navigation options. Small items allow for denser and more compact options so are best to use in situations with many nested layers of navigation items.

The width of the tree view is set by the screen size or the container it is placed within. Tree view item text will wrap onto the following line if it overlaps the side of the container. Text can instead be truncated with a tooltip with the `truncateTreeItem` prop.

Place the tree view at either side of the page to ensure it can always be accessed independent of the screen content. Tree views should fill the whole height of the container they sit within.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={treeViewFig4}
  imageAlt="An example of placing tree view within a width restricted container leading to truncation."
  state="bad"
  caption="Place tree view in a wide enough container to properly indent nested data."
/>

## Interaction behaviour

When a tree view item is selected, the link it points to will be loaded if provided. Any nested items will appear underneath the parent item.

Tree view items can scroll within the tree view if they surpass the height of the container.
