## Easy to use for everyone

The tree view items will focus top-down, including the child nodes of any expanded parent items.
Tree view items can be iterated over with the tab or up and down keys.
Enter and space keys can be used to expand the currently selected parent node, or to follow the link of the currently selected node.

## For Assistive Technology

Tree view items consist of a button and an extended text area. When using a screen reader, the title of the tree view will be declared first along with how many items it contains.
When focussed on a tree view item, screen readers will state its:

<ul>
  <li>Label</li>
  <li>Index</li>
  <li>State</li>
  <li>Number of nested items</li>
</ul>
Any tree view items which aren’t in focus will not be declared by the screen reader.
