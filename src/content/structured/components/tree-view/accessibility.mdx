## Easy to use for everyone

The tree view items will focus top-down, including any expanded parents’ child nodes, but any closed parent nodes will not be included in the focus order.
Tree view items can be iterated over with the tab or up and down keys.
Enter and space keys can be used to expand the currently selected parent node, or to follow the link the currently selected node points to.

## For Assistive Technology

Tree view items are made up of a button and an extended text area. When using ascreen reader, the title of the tree view will be declared first along with how many items there are within it.
When focussed on a tree view item, screen readers will state the label of a tree view item, its’ index, state, and how many nested items are within it. Any tree view items which aren’t in focus will not be declared by the screen reader.
