## Variants

### Sizes

Set the size of the date picker by using the `size` prop. This prop takes the values `small`, `default` or `large`. Depending on the chosen size, the prop will apply styling to increase or decrease the amount of spacing within the component.

export const sizes = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="small"></ic-date-picker>
<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="default"></ic-date-picker>
<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="large"></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="small" />
<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" />
<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="large" />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={sizes} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <div
    style={{
      display: "flex",
      flexDirection: "column",
      gap: "16px",
    }}
  >
    <IcDatePicker
      label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
      size="small"
    />
    <IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" />
    <IcDatePicker
      label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
      size="large"
    />
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

### Max width

Set the size of the input field by using the `--input-width` CSS custom property. The picker will grow, but not exceed its maximum supported width.

export const maxWidth = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker style="--input-width: 500px" label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="small"></ic-date-picker>
<ic-date-picker style="--input-width: 500px" label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="default"></ic-date-picker>
<ic-date-picker style="--input-width: 500px" label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="large"></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker style={{ "--input-width": "500px" }} label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="small" />
<IcDatePicker style={{ "--input-width": "500px" }} label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" />
<IcDatePicker style={{ "--input-width": "500px" }} label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" size="large" />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={maxWidth} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <div
    style={{
      display: "flex",
      flexDirection: "column",
      gap: "16px",
    }}
  >
    <IcDatePicker
      style={{ "--input-width": "500px" }}
      label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
      size="small"
    />
    <IcDatePicker
      style={{ "--input-width": "500px" }}
      label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
    />
    <IcDatePicker
      style={{ "--input-width": "500px" }}
      label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
      size="large"
    />
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

### Disabled

export const disabled = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disabled></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disabled />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={disabled} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disabled />
</ComponentPreview>

### Date formats

The `dateFormat` prop determines how dates are displayed. The supported formats are `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY` or `YYYY/MM/DD`.
The default format is `DD/MM/YYYY`.

export const dateFormats = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" ></ic-date-picker>
<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" date-format="MM/DD/YYYY" ></ic-date-picker>
<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" date-format="YYYY/MM/DD" ></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" />
<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" dateFormat="MM/DD/YYYY" />
<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" dateFormat="YYYY/MM/DD" />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={dateFormats} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: "16px" }}>
    <IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" />
    <IcDatePicker
      label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
      dateFormat="MM/DD/YYYY"
    />
    <IcDatePicker
      label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
      dateFormat="YYYY/MM/DD"
    />
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

### Value

The `value` prop sets the date in the input field. The value can be in any format supported by the `dateFormat` prop, in ISO 8601 date string format (yyyy-mm-dd) or as a JavaScript Date object.

export const valueSnippet = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" value="01/01/2024" ></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" value="01/01/2024" />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={valueSnippet} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <IcDatePicker
    label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
    value="01/01/2024"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Open at date

If no `value` is set, the `openAtDate` prop can be used to specify the date in view when the calendar view is opened. If not set to a value, the calendar will default to showing the current date.

The supported formats are the same as for the `value` prop.

export const openDate = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" helper-text="The calendar will open showing 25th December 2024, if no date selected" open-at-date="2024-12-25" ></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" helperText="The calendar will open showing 25th December 2024, if no date selected" openAtDate="2024-12-25" />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={openDate} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <IcDatePicker
    label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
    helperText="The calendar will open showing 25th December 2024, if no date selected"
    openAtDate="2024-12-25"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Start of week

The first day of the week can be changed by setting the `startOfWeek` prop. This is a numeric value where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. up to 6 = Saturday.

export const startWeek = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" start-of-week="0"></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" startOfWeek="0" />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={startWeek} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <IcDatePicker
    label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
    startOfWeek="0"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Disable days of week

Specific days of the week can be disabled from selection by setting the `disableDays` prop. The value can be set as an array of numeric values where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. up to 6 = Saturday.

export const disabledDaysOfWeek = [0, 6];

export const disableDays = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker id="weekday-picker" label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" ></ic-date-picker>
<script>
  document.querySelector("#weekday-picker").disableDays = [0, 6];
</script>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `const disabledDaysOfWeek = [0, 6 <IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disableDays={disabledDaysOfWeek} />;`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={disableDays} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <IcDatePicker
    label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
    disableDays={disabledDaysOfWeek}
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Max and min

The `max` and `min` props can be used to limit the range of dates available for selection. Values can be in any format supported by the `dateFormat` prop, in ISO 8601 date string format (yyyy-mm-dd) or as a JavaScript Date object.

export const maxMin = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" helper-text="Choose a date between the 1st and 31st of July" min="2024-07-01" max="2024-07-31" show-picker-today-button="false" ></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" helperText="Choose a date between the 1st and 31st of July" min="2024-07-01" max="2024-07-31" showPickerTodayButton="false" />`,
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={maxMin} style={{ flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <IcDatePicker
    label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
    helperText="Choose a date between the 1st and 31st of July"
    min="2024-07-01"
    max="2024-07-31"
    showPickerTodayButton="false"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Disable dates in past

export const disablePast = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disable-past ></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `<IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disablePast />`,

export const disableFuture = [
  {
    language: "Web component",
    snippet: `<ic-date-picker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disable-future ></ic-date-picker>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",

  datePicker.max = new Date(2024, 6, 31);
  datePicker.value = new Date(2024, 6, 15);
</script>`,
  },
  {
    language: "React",
    snippet: `export const DatePickerWithIcChange = () => {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState('Selected date:');
  const [value, setValue] = useState();
  const dateChangedHandler = (event) => {
    setValue(event.detail.value);
    setSelectedDate("Selected date:" + event.detail.value);
