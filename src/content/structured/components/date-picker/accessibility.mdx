## Easy to use for everyone

A [date input](/components/date-input) is contained within the date picker.

Focus is managed in three sections within the date picker. The top section is managed left to right, through month and year selectors. The middle section contains the calendar view or month / year list, with focus depending on navigation method used. The bottom section contains the ‘go to today’ and ‘clear’ buttons, with focus managed left to right.

The date picker should act as a focus trap so the user only cycles through the date picker dropdown when the date picker is open.

Use the clear icon in a [date input](/components/date-input) or clear button in a date picker to clear an input.

The date picker can be navigated with keyboard only input.

## For Assistive Technology

When moving to a date selection, screen readers will announce in the format “Monday 06 October 2023”.

When focussing the date picker calendar dates, screen readers will announce the date as weekday, date, month and year sequentially, for example “Choose Wednesday, 8 November 2023”.

When focus is trapped in the date picker dropdown screen, reader should announce route to exit focus. For example, “ic-date-picker, 03 July 2024, press ESC to exit”.

The date picker will only open when users select the date picker icon from within date input.
