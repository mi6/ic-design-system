## Canary components

Canary components are unstable components that are released for testing purposes.

We value any feedback from users willing to try them in their applications.

These components should not be used in production apps without understanding the risk that changes may occur in order to fix bugs or improve functionality.

For more information on canary components, read our approach to [releases and versions](/get-started/releases-versions).

## Component demo

<ComponentPreview>
  <IcDatePicker label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" />
</ComponentPreview>

## When to use

Use a date picker to select an event that is near to the present time.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={figure1}
    imageAlt="A date picker being used to select a nearby date"
    caption="Use a date picker to visualise and select dates."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

Use a date picker to select a date that is known or desired, such as an appointment.

Use a date picker to select a single date where visualising that date could be useful.

Use a date picker when there is a need to view a date in context. For example, if there is a need to see which day of the week a future event occurs.

## When not to use

Avoid using a date picker for well-known dates, such as dates of birth, because it is often easier to type this into a field. For example, if selecting 30/07/1966, consider using [date input](/components/date-input) as a date picker would require many clicks to arrive at the same date.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={figure2}
    imageAlt="A date picker being used to select a very distant date"
    caption="Avoid using a date picker when dealing with distant dates."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

## Sizing

Use the date picker size properties to change its vertical size and achieve compact or spacious layouts.

### Width

Use the resizing options to increase or decrease width to match other elements in a form.

Use the [date input](/components/date-input) resizing options to change size of the input and calendar between minimum and maximum widths. For example, to create a larger date picker, resize width of [date input](/components/date-input).

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={figure3}
  imageAlt="Two date picker examples at their maximum and minimum width"
  caption="Change the width of the date input to adjust the date picker width."
/>

## Content

### Labels

Use [content styling](/styles/content-style/principles) for help with building effective labels for people using date input.

### Helper text

Use helper text to indicate restrictions in your date input such as not allowing weekends.

### Placeholder

Use a placeholder to demonstrate an example of the desired input. Do not add essential information into the placeholder as it will be hidden when a date is entered into the field.

## Interaction

Set `open-at-date` to specify the date in view when the date picker is opened. If no date is set, the date picker will default to showing the current date.

The [date input](/components/date-input) and the date picker update according to any input made. For example, if 10/10/2100 is entered in the [date input](/components/date-input), the date picker will open to display the selection.

## Validation

### Standard

See [date input](/components/date-input#validation) for detailed guidance on how to display errors within the date picker.
