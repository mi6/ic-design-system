## Easy to use for everyone

Hero images use text elements that use semantic headings to provide proper order to the page content.

As hero banners can have different colour backgrounds, we've made sure that the foreground colours adjust automatically to ensure that the correct colour contrast standards are met.

Where images are used, alt-text should always be provided to give a description of the images content.

When using images as the background of the hero, safe areas describe where to leave space in an image so that the foreground content is not interfered with.

## For Assistive Technology

The hero banner uses slots to allow different types of components to be added. Where these components are interactive, then their normal focus behaviour is used.

The hero's content is ordered for focus in the following way:

- Title section including any subtitles
- Interaction area
- Right-hand section

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={heroFig17}
  imageAlt="A diagram of the hero banners main sections. The title section is labelled as first, the interaction section as second and the right-hand section as third."
  state="none"
  caption="The hero's content is ordered with the title section first, then the interaction section, then the right-hand section."
/>

## Testing

We've tested this component against WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It's been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
