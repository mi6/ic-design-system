## Introduction

Theme components are elements that define an application's overall look and feel.

These components allow for granular customisation and consistent design.

Whilst the theme components control the overall brand of the app, we offer individual CSS tokens that can be amended where necessary. For more information, you can check out our [colour tokens](/styles/colour).

## Components

The current theme and customisation components are:

- [Theme](/components/theme-customisation/theme)
