## Easy to use for everyone

The stepper component is informational and non-interactive, acting as a visual aid to inform the user about their current progress within a form.

## For Assistive Technology

The stepper is a visual aid and is non-interactive. It's therefore included in the tab-indexing for keyboard navigation as individual list items, allowing it to be read out by screen readers using the aria-current attribute.

## Based on

The stepper component has been based on the following resources:
