## Easy to use for everyone

The data entity component is descriptive and designed to inform the user in a comprehensive format about their inputs before making a submission. By including an interaction area, it provides users with a direct link or action to interact with an individual row.

## For Assistive Technology

The data entity can either be interactive or non-interactive. It is therefore included in the tab-indexing for keyboard navigation as individual entity items, allowing it to be read out by screen readers using the aria-current attribute.

## Based on

The data entity component has been based on the following resources:
