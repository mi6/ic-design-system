## Easy to use for everyone

Action chips can have `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` tags that provide additional content to the visible label. However, the visible label must be included within the accessible label.

When an interactive chip is disabled, the `aria-disabled` tag is set to `true`.

Make sure that focus is moved to an intuitive element of the page after a chip is dismissed.

When an icon is slotted into a chip, ensure it either has an accessible label provided through alt text on an `<img>`, a title element within an `<svg>`, or an `aria-label`. If the icon is purely decorative, use `aria-hidden=true` to hide it from assistive technology.
