## Component variants

<ComponentPreview style={{ gap: "0.5rem" }}>
  <IcActionChip
    label="Summon a coffee"
    onClick={() => console.log("Coffee summoned")}
  />
  <IcActionChip label="See more beans" href="#" target="_blank" />
</ComponentPreview>

Action chips are an interactive variant of [Chips](/components/chip). Action chips are sometimes referred to as “Clickable” or “Assist” chips. They use a similar colour scheme to Buttons. This means they are easy to identify when placed alongside other chip types and provide a visual indicator that an action will take place when clicked.

### Style

Action chip has two style variants.

#### Filled

Use filled chips to provide high emphasis on the displayed information.

#### Outlined

Use outlined chips to provide low emphasis on the displayed information.

## When to use

Use an Action chip to provide a clickable action when displayed alongside other chips. For example, 'Dismiss all' alongside a series of dismissible chips.
Only use an Action chip when presented with other chip components. Use a Button instead if chips are not present.

Common use cases include:

- Dismissing all displayed dismissible chips at the same time.
- Adding an event to a calendar.

  imageAlt="Five Action chips displayed in a row, each showing an icon and label to capture feedback on coffee. The options range from 'Very good' to 'Very bad'."
  state="good"
  caption="Use Action chips to display smart or automated actions."
/>

You can use Action chips in conjunction with other chip types to add smart or automated functions in context of the chip group.

  imageAlt="Three Dismissible chips, followed by an Action chip displayed in a row. The Dismissible chips show labels for different coffee types. The Action chip shows the label '+ five more'."
  state="good"
  caption="Use Action chips in conjunction with other chips."
/>

Action chips can be used as links to open content in a new window. In this case, an href must be provided and the “open in new window” icon displayed.

## When not to use

Don't use Action chips in isolation without other chips present.

Don't use Action chips to perform significant tasks such as clearing or submitting a form, use a [button](/components/button) instead. Buttons should be used for familiar and consistent calls to action.

    caption="Use Action chips to enhance the experience."

    imageAlt="A page of content showing two Action chips below on the left. One Action chip is outlined and labelled 'Clear' while the other is filled and labelled 'Save order'."

  />

## Content

For full guidance on content, please see the [Chip](/components/chip) page.

### Icons

Use the `target="blank"` property on Action chips to display the corresponding icon on the right of the label, if the action will open a new window.
