## Easy to use for everyone

Classification banners use colours that have been designed for maximum legibility across a range of colour vision impairments.

## For Assistive Technology

For screen reader users, classification banners feature a hidden label: “The protective marking of this page is:”. The classification banner is also announced as a landmark region.

## Testing

We’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. It’s been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
