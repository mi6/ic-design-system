## Introduction

Protective markings indicate the level of sensitivity of classified or controlled information.

<ComponentPreview style={{ gap: "0.5rem" }}>
  <IcClassificationBanner inline />
  <IcClassificationBanner classification="official" inline />
  <IcClassificationBanner classification="official-sensitive" inline />
  <IcClassificationBanner classification="secret" inline />
  <IcClassificationBanner classification="top-secret" inline />
</ComponentPreview>

## When to use

All apps, except public ones, require a classification banner. When multiple pieces of information require different markings, use classification banners on each component.

## Layout and placement

Place a single banner at the bottom of the viewport. The banner is always fixed and should not scroll with the page.

## Content

If there is information on a single page that has multiple different classifications, display the maximum classification with the text prefix of `UP TO`.

## Colour

Donâ€™t alter or customise the [classification banner colours](/styles/colour#classification) as they've been designed to meet accessibility requirements.

## Accessibility consideration

Make sure the classification banner is the first item that is read out to people who use screen readers. Put the component at the top of the DOM/HTML.
