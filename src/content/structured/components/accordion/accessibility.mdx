## Easy to use for everyone

We have used `aria-expanded` and `aria-collapsed` so that a screen reader announces the state of the accordion.

When navigating using the keyboard, use the tab button to move focus between accordions, and use the space and enter keys to open or close it.

If an input or actionable functionality is contained within an accordion, this is only accessible when the accordion is open.

If the accordion is closed, we make sure any functionality contained within the accordion is removed from the focus order.

## For Assistive Technology

The accordion component consists of a button and expanded area. The button uses `aria-expanded` so screen readers announce when the accordion panel is on display. `aria-controls` is also applied to the button to identify which expanded area is being controlled by the button.

The expanded content uses `aria-hidden`, which is set to `false` when the accordion is collapsed and `true` when expanded. The expanded content also has a `role` of `region` and `aria-labelled`, which links to the accordion heading within the button.

## Based on
