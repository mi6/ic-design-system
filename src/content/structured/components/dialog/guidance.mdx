## Introduction

Dialogs prompt users for additional information to proceed with their task. Dialogs appear modally, meaning that the user must take action to acknowledge the dialog before continuing.

Dialogs work best when used for short tasks or to alert the user to information relevant for their current task. A dialog appears on top of the main page content and is persistent until dismissed.

## Component demo

export const DialogExample = () => {
  const showDialog = () => {
    const dialog = document.querySelector("#example-dialog");
    dialog.showDialog();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <IcButton onclick={showDialog}>Launch dialog</IcButton>
      <IcDialog
        heading="This dialog has two buttons"
        label="Two buttons"
        id="example-dialog"
        buttonProps={[
          { label: "Cancel", onclick: "this.cancelDialog()" },
          {
            label: "Confirm",
            onclick: "alert('Confirmed!'); this.hideDialog()",
          },
        ]}
      >

          eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
        </IcTypography>
      </IcDialog>

  );

## When to use

Use dialogs to interrupt the user flow to display, collect or confirm information that is important to enable the user to continue their task.

Add action buttons to a dialog to present the user with a set of actions to choose from to continue.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={dialogFig1}
  imageAlt="An example dialog message for a coffee order saying 'Are you sure?' with buttons for 'Continue' and 'Go back'."
  state="good"
  caption="Use dialogs with buttons to present the user with a required action."
/>

Add interactive content inside a dialog's content area to capture key input such as providing confirmation of understanding by checking a checkbox.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={dialogFig2}
  imageAlt="An example dialog for a coffee order that says 'Please agree to our terms and conditions.' The dialog has a checkbox in its content that allows the user to signify agreement. There are two buttons for 'continue' and 'go back'."
  state="good"
  caption="Use dialogs with interactive content in the content area to capture key input from a user before continuing."
/>

Use dialogs to show additional information that can be opened from the underlying page. These dialogs can be passive and contain no actions other than a dismiss button to close the dialog.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={dialogFig3}
  imageAlt=": An example dialog containing additional information about the 'Americano' product."
  state="good"
  caption="Use dialogs to provide additional information that isn't displayed on the underlying page."
/>

Add a status [alert](/components/alert) to a dialog to provide additional meaning in relation to a specific status. These can include any alert status variant.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={dialogFig4}
  imageAlt="An example dialog for a coffee order asking if the user is sure they want to continue adding the product 'Americano' to their basket. It contains a warning alert that says 'Only a few left'."
  state="good"
  caption="Use a status alert within a dialog to highlight important information related to the dialog's content."
/>

Use dialogs when a destructive action is about to take place. Ask the user to confirm if they want to continue to conduct the action and provide a way of cancelling the action.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={dialogFig5}
  imageAlt="An example dialog for removing an item from a basket. It provides a destructive action button for 'Remove' and a secondary button for 'Go back'."
  state="good"
  caption="Use a dialog for destructive actions to give the user an option to back out at the last minute."
/>

## When not to use

Avoid using dialogs to contain complicated tasks or processes. Instead consider if such complex tasks could be placed on a page themselves.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={dialogFig6}
  imageAlt="An example dialog containing a multi-step form for selecting and adding drinks to an order. A stepper with four steps is used with multiple form elements inside each step."
  state="caution"
  caption="Whilst you can put any content within a dialog, avoid placing complex tasks in one and consider placing it on the main page itself."
/>

Don't place important information inside a dialog if it is not part of the main flow of task. Such information can be missed so consider placing it on the page itself. Avoid repeating information in a dialog that is displayed on the page itself.

Don't use dialogs when information from the main page content is required to complete a task within a dialog. Keep all information required to complete the task in a dialog within the dialog. If more information is required, consider if dialogs may not be suitable for the task.

Avoid overusing dialogs to bring every decision in a task to the user's attention. Use dialogs for the key actions in a task instead. Dialogs may be ignored if used too frequently.

Only show dialogs after a user action has triggered it, and make sure its content is contextual to the user action. Don't show dialogs if a user has not performed a specific action on the page.

## Interaction behaviour

Display dialogs after users complete a specific action on a page such as clicking a 'submit' button.

Always make sure the dismiss button is included within a dialog, and select whether to allow the dialog to close by clicking on the background scrim.

When a dialog is displayed, the page content in the background cannot be interacted with.

Content can scroll within the body of a dialog, whilst the header section and interaction section are sticky at the top and bottom of the dialog window.

## Sizing

Set the dialog's size dependent on the amount of content that is being displayed in it. Large dialogs take up most of the screen so are good to use when there is a lot of content to display such as a table. Small dialogs only use a small amount of the screen so are best used for short additional information.

On extra small breakpoints all dialogs automatically change to their full-screen setting to provide maximum space for their content.

## Content

Always give dialogs a meaningful heading and describe the task that the dialog contains.

Add an optional label to a dialog to add categorisation or other secondary information.

Specify any content within the dialog's body section, but take care not to place too much information in a dialog if it is best placed as a page itself.

Always follow the [content style](/styles/content-style) when writing textual content.
