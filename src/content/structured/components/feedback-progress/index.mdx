## Introduction

Feedback and progress components are elements that provide users with information about what is happening, and what steps remain. They are crucial for managing expectations and enhancing user experiences.

Feedback components inform users about the status or outcome of a process. They deliver updates and visual indicators to communicate success, errors, or other important information. Examples include alerts, status tags, and toasts.

Progress components provide a visual indicator for an ongoing process in response to a user action. They manage user expectations and provide a sense of control over the system. Examples include loading indicators and steppers.
