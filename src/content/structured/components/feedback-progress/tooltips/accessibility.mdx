## Easy to use for everyone

Tooltips can be used by people using any input method. They display by default on hover or on focus.

To ensure the tooltip content can be understood, the tooltip remains displayed if the cursor is moved over the tooltip area, even if it leaves the associated element’s area.

The text displayed within a tooltip is selectable so that it can be copied or focused with a virtual cursor.

## For Assistive Technology

Tooltips use `aria-describedby` or `aria-labelledby` to link it with the associated element.

Tooltips have an internal `silent` property, which applies `aria-hidden` to the tooltip when the tooltip information would have been duplicated, for example when an icon button has a `title` or `aria-label` set.

## Based on

The tooltip component has been based on the following resources:
