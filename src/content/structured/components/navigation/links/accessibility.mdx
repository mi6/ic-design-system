## Easy to use for everyone

Links use the semantic `<a>` HTML element (anchor element) with an `href` attribute to create a hyperlink.

## For Assistive Technology

Most screen readers will announce “link” before reading out a link. For example, a link labelled “Components” will be read out as “link components”.

## Based on

The links component has been based on the following resources:

<ul>
  <li>
    <ic-link
      target="_blank"
      href="https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/"
      rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
    >
      Links and Hypertext
    </ic-link>
