## Easy to use for everyone

The current page is always displayed in the component so that the user knows where in the data set they are.

When the user is at the start or end of the data, the navigation buttons are disabled so that it is clear there is no more data past that point.

## For Assistive Technology

Each pagination component uses accessible names for buttons that lack meaning in the context of a screen reader. Page buttons that simply have their page number as the visible label are given an accessible label of ‘Go to page X’ so that it is clearer what their function is.

The term ‘page X’ can be overridden in the case that it is not accurate. For example, this can be changed to read ‘sheet X’, ‘set X’, ‘slide X’ instead if it is a better representation.

Similarly, the icon buttons used for next, previous, first and last are also given accessible names so that their action is clearer when announced by a screen reader.

The pagination components use the `<nav>` element so that they become navigational landmarks on a page and can therefore be swiftly navigated to by users of assistive technology.

## Based on

## Testing

We’ve tested this component against WCAG 2.2 Level AA. It’s been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
