## Introduction

Navigation components are elements that guide a user through an application.

Using navigation components helps users navigate in three directions:

- Lateral navigation is moving between sections at the same level. Example components that would aid this navigation are tabs and side navigation.
- Forward navigation is progressing deeper into content. Example components that would aid this navigation are breadcrumbs and links.
- Reverse navigation is returning to a previous state. Example components that would aid this navigation are back to top and skip link.

For more information about navigation layouts, you can check out our [navigation patterns](/patterns/navigation-patterns).
