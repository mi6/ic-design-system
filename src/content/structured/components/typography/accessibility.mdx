## Easy to use for everyone

Typography uses the [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font for most text and [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans) for `h1` and `h2`. These are flexible and readable fonts that works well across digital and print.

By wrapping elements, it allows the use of semantic headings and HTML tags to structure the app, and retains flexibility.

Using correct HTML will allow assistive technologies to read an overview of the page when landmarks, regions and headings are implemented appropriately.

## Based on

The typography component is based on the following resources:

- [WCAG 2.1 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships), W3, accessed November 2022.

## Testing

We've tested this component against WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It's been tested with NVDA and VoiceOver, and several different users with different interaction methods.
