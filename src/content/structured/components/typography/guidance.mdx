## Introduction

The typography component is used to style text elements like `p`, `h1` and `label`. The element to be styled should be wrapped with the typography component.

The typography variants are defined on the [typography styles](/styles/typography) page.

Use one of the typography component's variants to style an element. For example, the following uses a `h2` variant to wrap a `h5` element and apply the 'heading large' styling.

<ComponentPreview>
  <IcTypography variant="h2">
    <h5>&lt;h5&gt; with 'heading large' styling</h5>
  </IcTypography>
</ComponentPreview>

## When to use

Use typography to provide consistent styling across an app's text content.

Use the logical order of `h#` tags in code for headings. For example, a `h3` heading needs to come after a `h2` heading but can be styled as any variant.

Add a variant to the typography element to change its style. This doesn't change the semantic level of the typography element so make sure to always adhere to <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/" rel="noreferer noopener nofollow">accessible heading levels</ic-link>. For example, body text with a variant of `h2` will appear visually as an `h2` but still be body text in the DOM.

## Vertical margins

When using a typography component within page content, apply the vertical margins to evenly space out text elements on the page.

If using the typography component within other components or compact layouts, don't apply vertical margins. You can then position the typography component with precision.
