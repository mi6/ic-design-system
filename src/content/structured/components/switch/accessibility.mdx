## Easy to use for everyone

A switch is selected or unselected using the **space bar** key when focused.

Additional I/O visuals have been added to assist to the understanding of which state of the switch means 'on' and which means 'off'.

High contrast colours have been used to emphasise the difference between 'on' and 'off' states. The conventional positioning of a switch's handle on the right-hand side also denotes the 'on' state.

## For Assistive Technology

Switches use the ARIA `switch` role so that the change of state is announced by screen readers.
