### Required

To set the date input as a required field, set the `required` prop to `true`. This will add an asterisk at the end of the date input label.

export const snippetsRequired = [
  {
    technology: "Web component",
    snippets: {
      short: `<ic-date-input label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" required="true"></ic-date-input>`,

      ],
    },
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={snippetsRequired}>
  <IcDateInput label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" required />

### Hide label

To hide the label, set the `hideLabel` prop to `true`. The required `label` will still be read out by screen readers.

export const snippetsHideLabel = [
  {
    technology: "Web component",
    snippets: {
      short: `<ic-date-input label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" hide-label="true"></ic-date-input>`,

          snippet: `{shortCode}`,
        },
        {
          language: "Javascript",
          snippet: `{shortCode}`,

      ],
    },
  },
];

<ComponentPreview snippets={snippetsHideLabel}>
  <IcDateInput label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" hideLabel />

### Disabled

Set the `disabled` prop to `true` to prevent interaction with the date input.

export const snippetsDisabled = [

### Custom helper text

Use the helper text to add additional detail for the date input. Display custom content using the `helper-text` slot.

export const snippetsCustomHelperText = [

### Custom validation

Validation on date input is set via the `validationStatus` and `validationText` props.

`validationStatus` will set the style of the validation message. `validationStatus` accepts:

- `error`
- `warning`
- `success`

`validationStatus` is required for the `validationText` to appear.

export const snippetsValidation = [

    validationText="Your coffee will be available for you to collect on this day."
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Disabled past dates

Validation can be set on the date input if a date in the past has been set by setting the `disablePast` prop to `true`.

Enter a date in the past to view the validation message:

export const snippetsDisabledPastDates = [
  {
    technology: "Web component",
    snippets: {
      short: `<ic-date-input label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disable-past="true"></ic-date-input>`,

</ComponentPreview>

### Disabled future dates

Validation can be set on the date input if a date in the future has been set by setting the `disableFuture` prop to `true`.

Enter a date in the future to view the validation message:

export const snippetsDisabledFutureDates = [
  {
    technology: "Web component",
    snippets: {
      short: `<ic-date-input label="When would you like to collect your coffee?" disable-future="true"></ic-date-input>`,

</ComponentPreview>

### Min and max

It is possible to set a minimum and maximum date range using the `min` and `max` props. If a date is set and it is before the minimum or after the maximum date, a validation error will appear.

The `min` and `max` props accept the same date formats as the `value` prop.

export const snippetsMinMax = [
  {
    technology: "Web component",
