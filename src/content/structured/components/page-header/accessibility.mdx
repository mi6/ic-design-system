## Easy to use for everyone

The page header is the start of a page's content, so all `skip to content` links should direct the user here. The page header sits within a page's `main` landmark.

We've made sure that all interactive elements inside of a page header follow the logical tab order.

Even when a page header is set to sticky scroll, it still sits in the normal tab order at the top of the page content.

A page header's child components follow the accessibility considerations outlined in their own guidance.

## For Assistive Technology

Page header titling uses correct heading styles in order to achieve good semantic structure and provide information about structure and content relationships when using assistive technology.

## Based on
