## Introduction

Layout components are elements that define the structure and arrangement of other elements.

For information about the general layout of a page, you can check out [layout and spacing](/styles/layout-spacing). For information about more specific layouts, you can check out our [patterns](/patterns).

## Components

The current layout components are:

- [Accordion](/components/layout/accordion)
- [Card Horizontal](/components/layout/card-horizontal)
- [Card Vertical](/components/layout/card-vertical)
- [Divider](/components/layout/divider)
- [Footer](/components/layout/footer)
- [Layout Grid](/components/layout/layout-grid)
- [Section Container](/components/layout/section-container)
