## Easy to use for everyone

Layout grids align content on the page, which helps to form a constant edge from which to read from. This allows for swift readability as a user can scan back to the same position to start the next line of content. It supports standard reading scanning patterns by creating a consistent baseline.

Consistent alignment also reduces cognitive load when trying to understand content on a page and helps to associate elements with one another through proximity and symmetry.
