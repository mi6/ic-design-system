## Easy to use for everyone

Static cards inherit the accessibility features of the components within the card. Clickable cards act as links and therefore inherit the accessibility features of links.

Screen readers should always read the heading first, even when an image is placed on the left of the card. To achieve this, we've re-ordered content using CSS Flexbox layout so that visually the image appears first but is placed after the heading section in HTML.

In the case of clickable cards, since the whole area is interactive, then the whole container is focusable.

Clickable cards inherit the accessibility features of the link style, using an `<a href="">` to wrap the whole component.

Provide as much detail as possible to the purpose of the action of a clickable card. If you can't show this within the component, use the `class="visuallyhidden"` to add descriptive text about the purpose of the call to action(s).

When cards are arranged in a group, these should be placed within an unordered list `<ul>`, with each card marked as a list item `<li>` to provide navigational cues for screen readers.
