## Introduction

An example of the back to top component.

<div id="scroll-to-target" style={{ position: "absolute", top: "-3.125rem" }}>
  <IcTypography>Top of page</IcTypography>
</div>

<ComponentPreview>
  <IcButton
    onClick={() => {
      window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);
    }}
  >
    Show Back to top component
  </IcButton>
</ComponentPreview>

## When to use

Use this component for pages with a lot of content that requires scrolling, such as intranets, reports and content-heavy apps.

Consider using it on all apps to improve usability for everyone, including keyboard-only and some assistive technology users.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={backToTopFig1}
  imageAlt="An example page that is scrolled half way down and showing an overlaid back to top button in the bottom right-hand side."
  state="good"
  caption="Display the back to top button when a page has been scrolled."
/>

## When not to use

Don't use when the page is designed to fill the viewport without scrolling.

Don't display the back to top button when the page is already scrolled to the top.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={backToTopFig2}
  imageAlt="An example page that fits within the viewport without scrolling. A back to top button is overlaid in the bottom right-hand side."
  state="bad"
  caption="Don’t show a back to top button when the page does not require scrolling, or is already scrolled to the top of the page."
/>

Only use the provided back to top component. Don't use any other button in place of the back to top component.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={backToTopFig3}
  imageAlt="An example page that is scrolled half way down and displays a primary button reading ‘Back to top’ in the bottom right corner instead of the back to top component."
  state="bad"
  caption="Don’t use any other component for providing back to top functionality. Use the back to top button."
/>

## Interaction behaviour

The back to top button targets the `main` region in your code.

Avoid setting focus to the top of the `body` because users will have to navigate through the header and navigation.

## Layout and placement

Don’t place the back to top button anywhere else as it may obscure important information or interactive components.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={backToTopFig4}
  imageAlt="An example page that is scrolled halfway that shows a back to top button overlaid in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. The button obscures a list of filters that appear behind it."
  state="bad"
  caption="Don’t show the back to top button anywhere other than the right-hand side as it may obscure other content.  "
/>

When the bottom of the page is reached, the back to top button anchors into place above the [footer](/components/footer).

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={backToTopFig5}
  imageAlt="An example page that is scrolled all the way to the bottom showing a footer component with the back to top button positioned above it."
  state="good"
  caption="The back to top button anchors above the footer when scrolled to the bottom of the page."
/>

## Motion

When clicked, the component should navigate to the top of the page without any scrolling animation.
