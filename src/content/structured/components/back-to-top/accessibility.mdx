## Easy to use for everyone

The button is located on the bottom right-hand side of a page. This is where users expect to see the button and it's out of the way of most other page content and navigational elements.

The button targets the main landmark in order to move focus to the top of the content and not require keyboard users to tab through all other navigational components.

We’ve made sure the component is WCAG compliant with movable interaction and keyboard accessible elements. When using the back to top button, no motion is applied to the automatic scroll.

## For Assistive Technology

Even for short screens, the recommendation is to use a back to top button as it provides people using assistive technology a way to quickly get back to the top of the content.
