## Easy to use for everyone

Chips can have `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` tags that provide additional content to the visible label. However, the visible label must be included within the accessible label.

When an interactive chip is disabled, the `aria-disabled` tag is set to `true`.

Make sure that focus is moved to an intuitive element of the page after a chip is dismissed.

## For Assistive Technology

Dismissible chips use the role of button as opposed to link in order to help users of assistive technologies understand that the button is performing an action on the page instead of navigating them to a new location. Users should be aware that activating the button will remove the chip from the list.
