## Component variants

There are two types of chips: dismissible chips and static chips. Dismissible chips have both filled and outline variants and are interactive, whereas static chips simply present information and aren't actionable.

### Dismissible chips

Use a dismissible chip to show selected data from a user action that can be cleared by dismissing the chip. This is often used in the context of filtering and selection.

#### Filled

Use filled dismissible chips to provide high emphasis on the displayed information

#### Outlined

Use outlined dismissible chips to provide low emphasis on the displayed information

#### Static chips

Use static chips to display information that does not need clearing. They aren't interactive so don't present any action and they can't be dismissed.

## When to use

### Dismissible chips

Use dismissible chips when you need to choose multiple items from a list but need to show items after they've been chosen.

Common use cases include:

- A list showing which filters have been selected for a search.
- Choosing multiple recipients of a message.

### Static chips

Use static chips when you need to simply display a piece of information with no interaction, such as a label.

Common use cases include:

- Labelling or drawing attention to a particular card or row because of its state.

- Displaying the current location of an item.

  state="good"
  caption="Use static chips to display descriptive, non-interactive information."
/>

## When not to use

### Dismissible chips

Don't use dismissible chips where the user can't re-select the item presented in the chip.

For example, if used to show a selected filter, after dismissing the chip and clearing the filter, it can be applied again later.

<video
  width="100%"
  muted
  controls
  loop
  title="An animation showing the user dismissing a chip labelled 'Roasted' and the option not re-appearing in the filter section."
>
  <source src={chipsVid1} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Don't use dismissible chips when the user will not be able to re-select the dismissed item.

<video
  width="100%"
  muted
  controls
  loop
  title="An animation showing the behaviour of a dismissible chip as it re-appears in the filter section when the user dismisses it."
>
  <source src={chipsVid2} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Allow users to re-select the item after it has been dismissed.

### Static chips

Don't use static chips to show status. Use [status tags](/components/status-tags) instead.

    imageSrc={chipsFig3}
    imageAlt="Three static chips labelled 'Idle', 'Offline', and 'Online' displaying the status of three coffee machines."
    state="bad"
    caption="Don't use static chips to denote status."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

## Layout and placement

### Chip grouping

When using chips in a group, make sure they are left aligned and are positioned next to each other in a row.

Only position chips on multiple rows if there isn't enough horizontal space to show them on one, or if they are segmented into labelled groups.

## Content

### Labels

Use concise labels as longer labels will be truncated if it forces the chip to exceed the maximum width.

### Icons

Use an icon on the left of a dismissible or static chip to provide additional meaning.

When including an icon in a chip make sure that the icon is understandable and relevant to the information presented.

Always provide alternative descriptions for icons. Don't use icons if they aren't necessary.
