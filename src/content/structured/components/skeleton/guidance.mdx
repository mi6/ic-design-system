## Introduction

Skeleton has three variants:

- Circle
- Text
- Rectangle

<ComponentPreview>
  <ic-skeleton />
</ComponentPreview>

### Circle

Use the circle variant as a placeholder for any circular components, like avatars and circular logos.

### Text

Use the text variant as a placeholder for any text or labels that sit outside of any component. This applies to helper text for input labels, headings and body text.

### Rectangle

Use the rectangle variant as a placeholder for any other components. This includes buttons, chips and tags, input fields and cards.

## When to use

Use skeleton variants as a placeholder for when a full page or individual components are loading. Don't nest skeletons. If a label or text is wrapped inside a component, for example in cards, only use the skeleton variant of the component that wraps the other components.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig1SkeletonLight, Fig1SkeletonDark]}
  imageAlt="An image which shows the card component and the rectangle skeleton variant used to replace the full card width and height while it’s loading."
  state="good"
  caption="Use skeletons to outline the whole component."
/>

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig2SkeletonLight, Fig2SkeletonDark]}
  imageAlt="An image showing a card component’s skeleton state including text skeleton variants used within another rectangle skeleton variant."
  state="bad"
  caption="Don't use skeletons within skeletons."
/>

### Sizing

Set the height and width of the skeleton to match the size of the component that will replace it once loaded.

When using the text variant, set the skeleton’s height to match the text style of the text that will replace it once loaded.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={[Fig3SkeletonLight, Fig3SkeletonDark]}
    imageAlt="A graphic of a list of text styles side by side with the correct text variant height."
    state="good"
    caption="Use the correct text style to match the size of the text."
  />
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={[Fig4SkeletonLight, Fig4SkeletonDark]}
    imageAlt="A graphic of a list of different text styles side by side with a list of skeleton components of the same height."
    state="bad"
    caption="Don't use the same skeleton size for different text sizes."
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

Don't replace large bodies of texts with one single large text skeleton. Replace each line with a separate text skeleton.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig5SkeletonLight, Fig5SkeletonDark]}
  imageAlt="An image showing multiple lines of text being replaced by multiple text skeleton components for each line of text."
  state="good"
  caption="Use a separate text skeleton component for each line."
/>

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[Fig6SkeletonLight, Fig6SkeletonDark]}
  imageAlt="An image showing multiple lines of text being incorrectly replaced by one large custom text skeleton."
  state="bad"
  caption="Don't scale the text skeleton to the full height of a body of text."
/>

## When not to use

Avoid displaying skeleton placeholders when something will load in 300ms or under to avoid flashing on the page. If needed, manually specify a 300ms delay, after which the skeleton component is displayed.

Don’t use skeleton loading states when the loading progress can be calculated. Instead, use [determinate loading indicators](/components/loading-indicator).

Don’t use skeleton components when the general structure of the page that will replace skeleton variants is not known. Instead, use [indeterminate loading indicators](/components/loading-indicator).
