## Basic form

This form layout involves displaying multiple form fields on one page.

Try to limit the number of fields on a page to about five or six.

Always keep the layout of the form simple by preferring a single column of fields.

Form fields should match the size of the answer you expect to each question &ndash; such as a short, single-line text field for a first name, or a long, multi-line text field for a paragraph.

    state="bad"

Align form fields to the left for a clean and consistent layout for your application.

## Multi-page form

Use a stepper (which is built into the [page header](/components/page-header) component) to separate a long form out into multiple pages.

Use multiple pages if your form is much longer than about five or six fields.
