## Introduction

Patterns are best practice designs or implementations for common user needs.

They support consistent interactions across a wide range of apps. They make it easier for people to switch between app contexts, identify common tasks, and still know how to use your app.

Patterns often use multiple [components](/components) and are always based on the [style tokens](/styles). All patterns have been tested to meet or exceed [accessibility requirements](/accessibility/requirement).
