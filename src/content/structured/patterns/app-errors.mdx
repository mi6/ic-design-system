## When to use

Display an app error when:

- When you need to make users aware that something’s not working as expected.
- When a system is partially functioning.
- When data sources are unavailable.
- Where an incoming data source SLA has been breached.
- When an app is unavailable for scheduled system maintenance.

## When not to use

- Don't use app errors for [form validation feedback](/patterns/form-validation).
- Don't use a [toast](/components/toast) for errors because a user might not notice the error message.

## Usage

App errors should bring sufficient context to allow the user to understand whether they can still use the app, and they should contain resolution information.

If possible, manage users' expectations on how long something will take to fix and offer workarounds (if available).

Use words that describe the cause of the error and, where possible, give the user a way to resolve it.

### Alerts

Use an alert if only part of an app (such as an asynchronous component) has a problem.

<ComponentPreview icds>
  <IcAlert
    heading="Something went wrong"
    message="The app couldn't connect to the server to download the latest information. Please check your connection or contact your local IT Service Desk."
    variant="error"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Dialogs and modals

Use dialogs for critical problems where you need to preserve information on the page.

For example, for a network problem when trying to save information and to prevent interaction with the rest of the app.

### Full page

Use full-page errors for the most critical problems, especially those that can't be resolved.

For example, use a full-page error message when content is missing or when the app fails to load.

<ComponentPreview noPadding left>
  <div style={{ padding: "2.25rem" }}>
    <IcTypography variant="h1" component="h3" applyVerticalMargins>
      LATTE STREET is unavailable
    </IcTypography>
    <IcTypography variant="body" applyVerticalMargins>
      This app is currently unavailable whilst we carry out an update.
    </IcTypography>
    <IcTypography variant="caption">
      Please check the <IcLink href="#">downtime calendar</IcLink> and try again
      later.
    </IcTypography>
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

### Persistent banner

Use a persistent banner at the top of an app experiencing a system or data problem. If multiple problems exist, group them into one banner.

Link to available support pages and provide resolution information (if available) to provide assurance and transparency to your users.

Be careful to keep persistent banners visually distinct when used alongside classification banners.

### Email

Use an email to notify users of a system being down, including for scheduled maintenance.

### Tone of voice

Write your error message with short, jargon-free language to inform your users and consider that errors can increase anxiety for people. An error shouldn't blame the user.

Use words that describe the cause of the error and, where possible, give the user a way to resolve it.

## Accessibility considerations

When building or using this pattern:

- Make sure components for app errors are announced to screen readers and other assistive technology.
- Don't use colour on its own to convey the app error. Always include text or iconography.
- Consider that errors can increase anxiety for people. An error shouldn't blame the user.
