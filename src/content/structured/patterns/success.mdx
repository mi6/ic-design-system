## When to use

Use a success message when you want to inform the user that a task has been successful.

For example, show a [success alert](/components/alert) on a subsequent page after submitting a form.

## When not to use

Don't overuse success messages. Don't add success validation to every text field.

Don't use full-page success messages. If a form is submitted successfully, consider a success alert component on the subsequent screen.

## Usage

### Toasts

Use a [toast](/components/toast) to deliver a passive success message. Use a snackbar when you don't need to guarantee a user will notice the message.

### Alerts

Use alerts to give feedback after a significant task. Alerts are more likely to be noticed by users.

For example, use a success alert on a subsequent page after submitting a request to give the user a reference number.

<ComponentPreview icds>
  <IcAlert
    heading="Application submitted"
    message="Your application for 'additional coffee allowance' was submitted successfully."
    variant="success"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

### Summary and 'review' pages

Only use a summary page after submitting a form if you need the user to export the information.

Don't use a full page for a success message; use a snackbar or alert on a list or homepage instead.

### Text fields

Use success messages on [text inputs](/components/text-field) if you need to validate information before submitting the form.

Use them in situations where you need immediate feedback, such as choosing a username.

<ComponentPreview icds>
  <IcTextField
    label="Username"
    value="coffeeninja005"
    validationStatus="success"
    validationText="This username is available."
  />
</ComponentPreview>

## Accessibility considerations

When building or using this pattern:

- Make sure components such as alerts are announced to screen readers and other assistive technology.
- Don't use colour on its own to convey that a problem has occurred; always include text.
