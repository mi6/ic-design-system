## About cookies and local storage

A cookie is a small file stored on your device when you visit a website. Cookies allow the website to recognise your device and remember your preferences or actions. Cookies can be 'session cookies' (deleted when you close your browser) or 'persistent cookies' (remain until they expire or you delete them).

Local storage is a browser feature that allows websites to store information on your device. This data is persistent and remains after you close your browser.

Cookies and local storage do not usually contain information that personally identifies you. We do not use them to collect or store personal data.

## How we use cookies and local storage

We use cookies and local storage to:

- Remember your cookie and storage preferences.
- Enable essential site functionality and security.
- Collect anonymous statistics to help us improve the site.

We do **not** use cookies or local storage to track you across other websites, nor do we share your data with third parties for marketing.
