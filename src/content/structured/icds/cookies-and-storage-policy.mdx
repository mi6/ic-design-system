## About cookies and local storage

A cookie is a file stored on your device that contains an identifier (usually a string of letters and numbers) when you access a website. When you visit the same website again, the cookies stored on your device are accessed by code on the website. This means that the website can recognise the device being used and provide useful features, such as remembering your preferences or keeping you logged in.

Local storage is a type of web storage that allows websites and apps to store data in a browser on a device. This data is persistent and remains even after the browser is closed. Local storage is often used to store user preferences and settings.

Cookies may be either 'persistent cookies' or 'session cookies'. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date. A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

Cookies that are set by the website owner are called 'first party cookies'. Cookies that are set by another platform or service are called 'third party cookies'. These tend to be used for additional services, such as advertising or analytics.

Cookies and local storage do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies and local storage.

We use cookies on this website to help improve the performance of our digital advertising and to collect basic data about how the website is used so that we can make decisions about how to improve it. We use local storage to remember your preferences and improve your experience on the website.
