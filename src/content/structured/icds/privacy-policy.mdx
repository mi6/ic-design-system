The [Intelligence Community Design System](/) brings together experts and users from across [SIS (also known as MI6)](https://sis.gov.uk), [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk), [GCHQ](https://gchq.gov.uk), and a number of partners. We've open-sourced the Design System to give an insight into what we do, and work with experts across a number of topics.

To do this, we work with contributors who don't work for or with SIS, MI5, GCHQ, or our partners. That means we may need to collect some personal data from them.

The Design System is run by SIS, MI5 and GCHQ, but SIS is the responsible entity for the website.

[Read SIS's entry in the Data Protection Public Register for accurate contact details](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZA455227).
