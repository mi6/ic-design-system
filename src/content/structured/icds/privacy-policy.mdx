## Our Privacy Policy

The [Intelligence Community Design System](/) brings together experts and users from across <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://sis.gov.uk" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SIS (also known as MI6)</ic-link>, <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MI5</ic-link>, <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://gchq.gov.uk" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GCHQ</ic-link> and a number of partners. We've open-sourced the Design System to give an insight into what we do, and work with experts across a number of topics.

To do this, we work with contributors who don't work for or with SIS, MI5, GCHQ, HMGCC, national security partner, or our additional partners. That means we may need to collect some personal data from them.

The Design System is run by SIS, MI5 and GCHQ, but SIS is the responsible entity for the website.
