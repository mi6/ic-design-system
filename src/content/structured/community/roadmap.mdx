## Introduction

The purpose of sharing the roadmap is to give our community an insight into our strategic plan, goals and milestones.

We use our roadmap to communicate plans. Priorities may change because of organisation strategies, or community requirements. We will aim to keep this page up to date.

Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/mi6/projects/2/views/1) for a more detailed view of our day-to-day activities and the work completed in our increments.

We welcome contributions of code, issues raised and more. Read about [how to contribute](/community/contribute).
