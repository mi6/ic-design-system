## Things to consider before contributing

- You can contribute more than just code! Please suggest new ideas or contribute to existing components or patterns.
- You can add written guidance to the website or designs in Figma.
- You should contribute in <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://stenciljs.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StencilJS</ic-link> where you can. If that is not possible there will be a delay in the contribution.
- We’ve adopted the <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Contributor Covenant</ic-link>, as expanded on in our <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Code of Conduct</ic-link>. The core team, Working Group and contributors should always keep it in mind.
- Read the [contribution criteria](/community/contribute-criteria).
- For internal users, you can talk to us on the internal platforms, or raise an issue on GitHub for either our <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/issues" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Design System</ic-link> or <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit/issues" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UI Kit</ic-link>.

## Raise a bug or suggest an improvement

Raise a bug or suggest improvements including brand new proposals to the UI Kit.

1. Raise a bug or suggest an improvement to the UI Kit through <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/issues" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GitHub issues</ic-link> with as much information as possible.
2. Internal users can raise a bug or suggest an improvement to the UI Kit through our Service Desk.
3. The working group will triage your ticket and get back to you. The Working Group meet on a fortnightly basis to review new tickets, but important bugs will be reviewed sooner.

## Contribute code

You can help us speed up the development of our Design System by contributing new components and patterns or making improvements to existing ones.

1. Select a ticket from the <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/issues" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Design System</ic-link> or the <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit/issues" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UI Kit</ic-link> backlog.
2. If a backlog ticket doesn’t exist for your contribution, you can suggest it through GitHub <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/issues" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Design System</ic-link> or <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit/issues" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UI Kit</ic-link> issues, or our internal Service Desk.
3. If you're an internal user, we will arrange a kickoff meeting to discuss the scope, plan and agree any support. For any external users, we'll work with you through GitHub issues.
4. Refer to the technical instructions for <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Design System</ic-link> or the <ic-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UI Kit repository</ic-link> coding standards and practices. If you're contributing a feature, we recommend reading through the [glossary of terms](/community/glossary-of-terms) to help with prop/slot naming.
5. Create a branch off `develop` to begin. Make sure that the 'copy main branch only' setting is unchecked when forking.
6. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch for review.
