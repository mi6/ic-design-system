## Inclusive

We write for everyone. We realise people can interpret our words in different ways.

We assume no existing knowledge or technical skill.

We write non-gendered.

## Human

We write for real people and speak to them as if we're in a conversation.

We use contractions: it's, you'll, you're, we're, let's.

Read out your writing and check that it sounds natural.

## Useful

We tell people only what they need to know.

We keep content to the point.

Shorter sentences are easier for people to scan. Theyâ€™re more accessible for people who struggle with reading or have a cognitive impairment.

## Simple

Use simple words to make it easier to read.

We write only what we need to and strip excess words from what we write.

We aim for a reading age of 9 to 11 years old. Adults still prefer and recognise the words they learned as a child.
