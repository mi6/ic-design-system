## Using consistent typography

Well-defined typography creates obvious hierarchy and helps to organise information.

<p>
  The Design System uses the{" "}
  <ic-link
    target="_blank"
    href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans"
    rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
  >
    Open Sans
  </ic-link>{" "}
  font for most text and{" "}
  <ic-link
    target="_blank"
    href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans"
    rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
  >
    Nunito Sans
  </ic-link>{" "}
  for large headings. These are flexible and readable fonts that work well
  across digital and print.
</p>

## Headings

Write all headings in sentence case.

Use the logical order of `h#` tags in code. For example, a `h3` heading needs to come after a `h2` heading but can be styled as any variant. It's important that [heading tags are used properly](/accessibility/coding/headings).

<TypographicScale variants="h1, h2, h3, h4" />

## Subtitles

Write all subtitles in sentence case.

Use subtitles for sub-section headings and table headings.

<TypographicScale variants="subtitle-large, subtitle-small" />

## Text

Write all body text in sentence case.

Use a minimum of 16pt for body text. 18pt should be used for apps with a lot of text (like intranets or reports).

<TypographicScale variants="body, caption, caption-uppercase" />

## Labels

<TypographicScale variants="label, label-uppercase" />

## Links

If your link is at the end of a sentence or paragraph, make sure that the linked text does not include the full stop.

<TypographicScale variants="link" />
