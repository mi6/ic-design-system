## Introduction

The way we write, and [how we present it](/styles), can make or break an experience. Use this content style guide to support readability and engagement of your written content and apps.

This guide applies to content you write in apps (like error messages) through to user guides and corporate comms.

Our goal is to create informative, helpful and clear content. This isn't about 'dumbing content down' - our job is to 'open it up'. We want as many people as possible to understand and engage with what we write.

Speaking in an 'active voice', we use short sentences, subheadings, simple vocabulary and always write in plain English.
