This guide applies to content you write in apps (like error messages) through to user guides and corporate comms.

Our goal is to create informative, helpful and clear content. This isn't about 'dumbing content down'&mdash;our job is to 'open it up'. We want as many people as possible to understand and engage with what we write.

  short sentences, subheadings, simple vocabulary and always writing in plain English.

The more readable text is the more easily users can understand its content. Text with poor readability turns off readers and can make it challenging for them to stay focused.
