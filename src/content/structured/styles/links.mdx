## Introduction

It's important to make sure link text tells users where they are going and why. This is because link text should make sense without context (the words around the link).

Avoid writing 'click here' or 'read more'.

| **Like this...**                                                   | **Not like this...**                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Find out about the <a href="#0">changes to the expense policy.</a> | Find out about changes to the expense policy. <a href="#0">Read more here.</a> |

Start with a verb when telling people to do something.

| **Like this...**                          | **Not like this...**                 |
