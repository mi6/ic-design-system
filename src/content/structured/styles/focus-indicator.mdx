## Enclosing components

The focus indicator shows users where they are on a page. It encloses most components and inherits their shapes. They are especially useful for keyboard-only and power users.

When applied to squared components, for example [buttons](/components/button), [text field](/components/text-field) and [checkboxes](/components/checkbox), the focus indicator will fully enclose the component and therefore appear squared.

When applied to rounded components, for example [radio](/components/radio), [switch](/components/switch) and [back to top](/components/back-to-top), the focus indicator will appear rounded.

## Links

When links are focused, the indicator will appear as the hover state.

## Positioning and layout

### Adjacent to components

For most components, the focus indicator will enclose the full component, appearing directly adjacent to its borders.

### Internal to components

Focus indicators are required to be fully visible. For components that are adjacent to other components, or the viewport edge, the focus indicator appears internal to the component to remain visible.

Enough padding is provided within these components so that no content is obscured. Make sure to always confirm that no part of the focus indicator or the component's content is clipped or obscured.

## Navigation

Keyboard navigation controls vary between components. For specific information, refer to the 'Accessibility' tab in a component's page.

## Accessibility considerations

  criteria for Level AA (and in some cases AAA) requirements.

Given the requirements are still a draft and may be subject to change, we will track these criteria to make sure this style token remains conformant.
