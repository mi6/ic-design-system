## Abbreviations and acronyms

We regularly use abbreviations and acronyms, especially in technology. Write out the words the first time you mention it, then use the short version next time.

For example, write 'Intelligence Community Design System (ICDS)' the first time you mention it. Then 'ICDS' the second time.

## Ampersands

Don’t use ampersands in body text. “And” should be spelled out in sentences and paragraphs. Spelling out “and” improves readability and makes scanning easier. Use ampersands only if they are part of a logo or in a brand name.

## Paragraphs

A paragraph should be made up of two to three sentences if possible.

## Capitalisation

We don't use block capitals as they're difficult for people to read.

Capitalise proper nouns and write everything else in sentence case. A proper noun is often a specific place, person or thing.

Sentence case is where only the first letter of the first word in a sentence or phrase is capitalised. Using capital letters for special or important words can be highly subjective and can result in inconsistencies across an organisation.

| **Like this...**       | **Not like this...**   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Date and time          | Date and Time          |
| Text fields            | Text Fields            |
| Intelligence Community | Intelligence community |

## Bold

Only use bold to refer to text from interfaces in technical documentation or instructions &ndash; use bold to explain what field a user needs to fill in on a form, or which button they need to select. For example: “Select **Continue** to open the certificate window.”

## Italics

Do not use italics. Use ‘single quotation marks’ if referring to a document, scheme or initiative.

## Underline

Never use underline to emphasise your text because underline is used to indicate hyperlinks.

## Full stops

Don't use full stops in headings, list items (which are not full sentences), buttons or action links.

## Lists

- Consistent lists are easier to read and will be read properly by assistive technology. List items should end with a full stop if they are complete sentences.
- Begin list items with a capital letter.

## Footnotes

Do not use footnotes on web pages. They’re designed for reference in print, not web pages. Always consider the user need first. If the information in the footnotes is important, include it in the body text. If it’s not, leave it out.

## Exceptions

Not all scenarios will be covered by this guidance &ndash; do what makes sense. For example, writing the number in words in the example below.

| **Like this...**                                  | **Not like this...**                           |
