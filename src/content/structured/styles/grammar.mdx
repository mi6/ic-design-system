## Abbreviations and acronyms

We regularly use abbreviations and acronyms, especially in technology. Write out the words the first time you mention it, then use the short version next time.

For example, write 'Intelligence Community Design System (ICDS)' the first time you mention it. Then 'ICDS' the second time.

## Ampersands

Use ampersands only if they are part of a logo or in a brand name.

## Paragraphs

A paragraph should be made up of 2 to 3 sentences if possible.

## Capitalisation

We don't use block capitals as they're difficult for people to read.

Capitalise proper nouns and write everything else in sentence case. A proper noun is often a specific place, person or thing.

| **Like this...**       | **Not like this...**   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Date and time          | Date and Time          |
| Text fields            | Text Fields            |
| Intelligence Community | Intelligence community |

## Full stops

Don't use full stops in headings, buttons or action links.

## Lists

Consistent lists are easier to read and will be read properly by assistive technology.

- List items should end with a full stop.
- Begin list items with a capital letter.

## Exceptions

Not all scenarios will be covered by this guidance - do what makes sense. For example, writing the number in words in the example below.

| **Like this...**                                  | **Not like this...**                           |
