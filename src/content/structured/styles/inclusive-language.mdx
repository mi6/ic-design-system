## Introduction

We firmly agree with "Nothing about us without us"<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Where possible, we have developed the Design System and its content style with input from across the communities. This includes disability advisory networks, affinity groups and expertise from the UKIC.

## Addressing potentially sensitive topics

Some friendly terms can unintentionally exclude big groups of people. For example, 'hi folks', 'you guys' or 'all of mankind' refer to gender identity<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. People have different beliefs, identities or perceptions that can change how they feel about these words.

### Social Model of Disability

<p>
  This Design System is an exception to talking about disability, impairment and
  other situations that affect how people work. The Design System language and
  principles are designed around{" "}

    The Social Model of Disability
  </ic-link>
  .
</p>

"The social model of disability is a way of viewing the world, developed by disabled people... The model says that people are disabled by barriers in society, not by their impairment or difference."<sup id="ref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>

### Disability and difference

While some words are inoffensive in certain contexts some words are offensive in any context and should always be avoided.

It's important to consider the context when using some terms. For example, "falling on deaf ears" can be interpreted as offensive.

### Examples of Inclusive Language

This is not an 'Intelligence Community approved' list of terms but explains the reasoning for language you encounter within the Design System.
