## Voice

Voice is like our personality. When we write, we want to appear that the 'user interface is talking to the user' and remember that everyone needs to understand what we're trying to say.
Therefore our voice is personal, inclusive and plain-spoken.

We:

- Address the user as 'you'.
- Avoid using 'should' as it can sound patronising.
- Use 'can' and 'may' appropriately &ndash; 'can' implies ability and 'may' implies permission and even uncertainty.
- Use language that is open, inclusive to all and that our users want us to use.

## Tone

Tone is like our mood. We adapt our tone depending on the context.

For example, we may use a direct, serious and reassuring tone when writing about a new government legislation or data handling policy.

## Tips

### Active not passive voice

Active voice is easier to read because it identifies the 'thing' that's doing the action.

Words like 'was' or 'by' may indicate that you're writing in a passive voice.

### Be direct

Writing 'to the point' will help you write simple content.

The simple principle is about getting readers the information they want as quickly as possible.

### Swap formal words for normal ones

Use language you would use if you were talking with the person youâ€™re writing to.
