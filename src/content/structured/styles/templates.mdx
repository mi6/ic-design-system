## Using layout templates

Use different combinations of navigation components and page content to create different layouts.

Some combinations work better for particular use cases. Side navigation takes up less room on data-heavy apps, but top navigation offers simpler navigation for content-based apps. Use the following templates to quickly create new pages.

Side navigation is preferred for most apps as it provides more screen space for main content.

## Side navigation

Use the [side navigation](/components/side-navigation) layout for data-heavy apps. This template prioritises the main content area, giving it the full height and width of the viewport. The navigation items in the side navigation give access to your app’s main functions from every page.

  state="none"
  caption="The side navigation template is useful for data-heavy apps."
/>

## Top navigation

[Top navigation](/components/top-navigation) works well for content-based apps, such as an intranet, blog or this Design System. The main navigation items can always be accessed at the top of the page. This layout often uses large margins to achieve a readable line-length for the page’s main content section.

<DoDontCaution

  imageAlt="An example app titled ‘Java nice day’ that uses a top navigation and has some example content laid out on a 12-column grid."
  state="none"
  caption="The top navigation template is useful for content-based apps."
/>

## Secondary navigation

Use secondary navigation components within these templates to provide additional navigation within each main section of an app.

### Page header

A [page header](/components/page-header) can be added to any page in an app, giving it a title as well as offering secondary-navigation options through tabs or a stepper.

Use [tabs](/components/tabs) to provide access to related pages where the content is mutually exclusive from one another.

Use a [stepper](/components/stepper) to signpost a user through a linear series of steps to complete a process or view information in a particular order.

<DoDontCaution

  imageAlt="Two examples of a side-navigation layout each with a page header. One uses a page header with tabs to provide secondary navigation. The other uses a page header with a stepper."
  state="none"
  caption="Two examples of a side-navigation layout each with a page header. One uses a page header with tabs to provide secondary navigation. The other uses a page header with a stepper."

### Hero

A [hero](/components/hero) can be included on homepages to signpost key links or actions in an emphasised position. Don’t use hero banners on every page though.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={templatesFig4}
  imageAlt="An example app using a top navigation layout with a hero banner that provides a key link titled ‘Get started’."
  state="none"
  caption="Use top navigation and hero on a homepage to introduce the app or provide direction to a key action (such as search or get started)."
/>

## Accessibility considerations

When using these layout templates use appropriate HTML regions such as `<main>` and `<nav>`.
