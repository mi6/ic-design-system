## Numbers

Write out the number in words if it starts a sentence.

| **Like this...**                                     | **Not like this...**                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Eleven herbs and spices in our fried chicken recipe. | 11 herbs and spices in our fried chicken recipe. |

When the number is below 10, write the word.

| **Like this...**                               | **Not like this...**                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| There was only one pizza left on the shelf.    | There was only 1 pizza left on the shelf.          |
| I saw someone with 12 pizzas in their trolley. | I saw someone with twelve pizzas in their trolley. |

## Dates

Use the 24-hour clock with a colon between the hour and minutes.

| **Like this...**             | **Not like this...**       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| At 14:00 the crow will call. | At 2pm the crow will call. |

Write out dates in words, rather than suffixes or slashes in dates, unless space doesn't allow you to do so.

| **Like this...** | **Be careful with...** |

## Times

For approximate times, round to the nearest whole number. Remember to write numbers below 10 as words.

| **Like this...**                     | **Not like this...**                |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| You last logged in two minutes ago.  | You last logged in 2 minutes ago.   |
| You last logged in five minutes ago. | You last logged in 4.5 minutes ago. |
| You last logged in 10 minutes ago.   | You last logged in ten minutes ago. |

Zulu time should be used when writing for times that involve other countries.
