## Introduction

We love what we've built. It’s already helped MI6, MI5, and GCHQ to create powerful and accessible capabilities that keep the UK and its partners safe and prosperous.

We’ve built our own Design System because of our unique requirements. We needed both flexibility and solid accessibility to [unlock efficiencies](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/28/podcast-gov-uk-design-system/) at speed. We will continue to build on great Design Systems like the [UK Government Digital Service’s Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and contribute back where possible.

We’re passionate about making sure that everyone can contribute equitably to our shared missions. We believe our Design System is the best way to help our teams and partners do that

## Changing a culture

Building our own Design System and UI Kit allows our teams and partners to join us on this journey. It’s key for our growth that they have a deep understanding of accessibility and good design practice.

Every organisation has a different culture. We’re supporting Engineering change across three huge departments and have proven it’s not as simple as ‘do what I say’ and ‘use this style guide’.

We need teams to understand the value of consistent, usable and accessible design. To achieve this across departments, platforms, technologies and skill level required a collaborative and community-driven approach.

## Game-changing potential

Faster capability development benefits everyone. The Design System has already proven that we can simultaneously speed up and improve the quality of what we build. This means the community and assets we adopt can better serve our fast-changing mission needs and we are confident on them being accessible.

The benefits of build-once and deep collaborative working, offered by our Design System have proven invaluable. We estimate our Design System will eventually speed up development by about 30%. In March 2022, we calculated that our prototype Design System delivered dev-and-design time efficiency improvements of about 15%. This is compared to using third-party open source component libraries.

## This is for everyone

The complexity of the capabilities in use are high and user needs are often open-ended and require a level high skill. The key value delivered by our Design System is repeatable patterns across a huge number of diverse but interconnected systems.

Inclusion and accessibility is core to our Design System. We’ve put a lot of effort into the atomic design components (typography, buttons). We decided this to instil confidence in the control of our ecosystem as we learn more about the vast use cases we encounter

## What now?

We’re interested to see the potential of our work and where it we can go now, sharing it with more and more people. Open sourcing is a big step, and opportunity, for MI6, MI5, and GCHQ.

We hope our experiences can support your efforts in improving accessibility and usability of complex government, enterprise, and specialist technology.

We want our Design System to continue to evolve and we’re excited to see what happens next. Please join us on this journey
