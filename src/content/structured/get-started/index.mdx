## Introduction

Our Design System helps MI6, MI5 and GCHQ to create powerful and accessible capabilities that keep the UK and its partners safe and prosperous.

The Design System has already proven that we can simultaneously speed up and improve the quality of what we build. This means the community and assets we adopt can better serve our fast-changing mission needs and we can be confident in them being accessible.
