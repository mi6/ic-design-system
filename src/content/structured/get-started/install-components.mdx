## Using third-party components

If you can't find a suitable component in the Design System, then you should use one from a third-party library. Use the Design System's theming and customisation options to [style](/styles) the third-party component so they look and feel as similar as possible.

Make sure to regularly check the Design System for new component releases so that you can replace the third-party components once released.
