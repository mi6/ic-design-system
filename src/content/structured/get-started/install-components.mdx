## Using third-party libraries alongside ICDS

If you can't find a suitable component in ICDS, then you can use one from a third-party library in your project. Use that library's theming and customisation options to style the third-party component following the [ICDS styles](/styles) so that they look and feel as similar as possible on the page. Make sure to check for new component releases from ICDS regularly so you can replace the third-party components with ICDS ones when they are released.
