## Before you start

<IcAlert
  variant="warning"
  heading="Experimental implementation"
  message="Currently there is no official ICDS support."

These wrapped components are not as rigorously tested or checked as the other component libraries. Day-to-day usage of a pre-release by a small number of teams
lends a degree of confidence however no guarantee is made that everything will function as expected. ICDS have no plans to give more support to this endeavour and so any
future improvements (such as bugfixes, Storybook tests, individual component documentation) will need to be community-driven. The wrappers should automatically keep up to
date with changes to the underlying components however.

This also means that there is no current offering for the canary components; if this is something that will benefit your project raise a Github issue.

### Choice of approach

Angular can support the use of non-native custom components for building apps as well as the standard importing of native Angular-based component libraries.
The ICDS component suite has been configured to provide wrapped versions of each component that can be used as if they were native components for ease,
but as the core components are written as standards-compliant web components, developers are free to use the original suite in their Angular apps instead.

The native component wrappers have been created as this will allow Angular developers a better way to interface with the UI Kit however and so this is the recommended approach.
A list of the benefits of using the native components can be found <IcLink target="_blank" href="https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Stencil's docs</IcLink>
, but to summarise here: they remove any idosyncracies that might arise from having components that Angular needs to handle differently; therefore the components will now behave just the same as the rest of the app.

If you do want to use the vanilla web components instead you can do so by following the Getting Started guide for vanilla components here and also including `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` in the `schemas` key of either the
Module or the Component declaration of any components that use the ICDS components.

## Installation

To install the components you have a two different methods. Either using the ng add command to streamline the process or a manual install:

### Using ng add

This will install all the necessary packages and setup your project. In the root of your project:

```shell
ng add @ukic/angular
```

### Manual setup

#### Step one

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/angular @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/angular @ukic/fonts
```

### Step two

To get the correct styling with the ICDS components, you will need to import the core CSS file and the fonts css file.

Add the following into your angular.json file in the build styles config

```json
{
    "styles": [
        ...
        "node_modules/@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css",
        "node_modules/@ukic/angular/css/core.css"
    ]
}
```

<br />

<p>
  In order to be rendered consistently across browsers and in line with modern
  standards, each of the components uses styles from a global CSS file based on{" "}
  <ic-link
    target="_blank"
    href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/"
    rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"
  >
    Normalize.css
  </ic-link>
  .
</p>

If you would like to import these styles to apply them to the rest of your project and slotted elements used within any of the components, add the following into the top level CSS file as well.

```css
@import "@ukic/web-components/dist/core/normalize.css";
```

### Step three

Due to a conflicting issue with typescript you need to add `skipLibCheck: true` to your `tsconfig.json`.

## Using the components in your app

<IcAlert
  heading="Documentation"
  message="There is currently no Angular-specific per-component documentation though using the the web components reference in combination with intellisense should work well."

/>

To use the ICDS components in angular your usage will vary based on if you are using a standalone project or using NgModules.

### NgModule application

You will need to import the `ICDSModule` from `@ukic/angular` into your NgModule. This will import all of the components and make them available and then you can follow the web component documentation.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { ICDSModule } from "@ukic/angular";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, ICDSModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Standalone application

You will need to import each component as you need it into your components from `@ukic/angular/standalone`. If you are using a form control you will need to also import `ICDSValueAccessorModule` into your component. Once you've imported it you can then you can follow the web component documentation.

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { IcButton } from "@ukic/angular/standalone";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [IcButton],
  template: `<ic-button variant="primary">I am a button</ic-button>`,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { FormControl, FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule } from "@angular/forms";
import { IcTextField, ICDSValueAccessorModule } from "@ukic/angular/standalone";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  template: `<ic-text-field
    label="Text field control"
    placeholder="Text field..."
    [formControl]="textFieldControl"
  ></ic-text-field>`,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [
    FormsModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    IcTextField,
    ICDSValueAccessorModule,
  ],
})
export class FormControlsComponent {
  textFieldControl = new FormControl("i am a text field");
}
```
