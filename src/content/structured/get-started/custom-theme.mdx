## Introduction

Some components can have their theme colour changed by using either of the methods below. When the theme colour is changed, components will automatically update.

Other styles on affected components will also adapt accordingly, such as text colour and focus border indicators.

## CSS variables

```css
:root {
  --ic-theme-primary-r: 92;
  --ic-theme-primary-g: 9;
  --ic-theme-primary-b: 72;
}
```

## Theme component

Alternatively, you can include the `ic-theme` component and set the `color` property:

```jsx
<ic-theme color="rgb(92, 9, 72)"></ic-theme>
<ic-theme color="#5c0949"></ic-theme>
```

### Components that use the theme colour

- [Footer](/components/footer)
- [Hero](/components/hero)
- [Side navigation](/components/side-nav)
- [Top navigation](/components/top-nav)
