## About the Figma UI Kit

We've built a Figma UI Kit to use alongside the guidance and code you'll find on this website. It'll make it easier to prototype and build things quickly.

All Figma resources have been built with our users in mind, with a strong focus on making sure accessibility is embedded from the start. That way what we can provide an amazing experience, usable for everyone

## Accessing the library

<IcAlert
  title="Need to know"
  message="The Figma UI Kit is currently only available to internal users, but we will be sharing it publicly soon."
  variant="info"
/>

The UI Kit is turned on by default for all projects within our Figma organisation.

1. In a new or existing Figma design file, click 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel then click the 'Team library' icon (the book).
