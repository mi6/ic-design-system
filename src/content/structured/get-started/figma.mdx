## About the Figma UI Kit

We've built a Figma UI Kit to use alongside the guidance and code you'll find on this website. It'll make it easier to prototype and build things quickly.

All Figma resources have been built with our users in mind, with a strong focus on making sure accessibility is embedded from the start. That way we can provide an amazing experience that is usable for everyone.

## Accessing the library for internal users

The UI Kit is turned on by default for all projects within our community. Check that you are using the latest version.

1. In a new or existing Figma design file, click 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel then click the 'Team library' icon (the book).

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={figmaFig1}
    imageAlt="Image of the left-hand side panel in Figma with the 'Assets' tab open and icon buttons on the right of the panel including the 'Team library' button."
    state="none"
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

2. Make sure the Intelligence Community Design System library is turned on.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={figmaFig2}
    imageAlt="Image of the Libraries menu in Figma with the Intelligence Community Design System library turned on."
    state="none"
  />
