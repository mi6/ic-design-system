## About the Figma UI Kit

We've built a Figma UI Kit to use alongside the guidance and code you'll find on this website. It'll make it easier to prototype and build things quickly.

All Figma resources have been built with our users in mind, with a strong focus on making sure accessibility is embedded from the start. That way we can provide an amazing experience that is usable for everyone.

## Accessing the library for internal users

The UI Kit is turned on by default for all projects within our community. Check that you are using the latest version.

1. In a new or existing Figma design file, click 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel then click the 'Team library' icon (the book).

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={[Fig1AssetsLight, Fig1AssetsDark]}
    imageAlt="Figma screen showing Assets with ICDS libraries listed."
    state="none"
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

2. Make sure the latest Intelligence Community Design System library is added.

<DoDontCaution
  imageSrc={[FigmaLibrary, FigmaLibraryDark]}
  imageAlt="Image of the Libraries menu in Figma with the Intelligence Community Design System library turned on."
  state="none"
/>

## Enabling dark mode on components

ICDS has dark mode variants for each component, which you can toggle between in your Figma designs.

You can achieve this as follows;

1. Select the component in the design.
2. On the right-hand side, under component properties, locate the `Theme` dropdown.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={[Fig3CompProperties, Fig3CompPropertiesDark]}
    imageAlt="Figma properties for a component showing Theme dropdown."
    state="none"
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>

3. Change the selected value from `Light` to `Dark`.
4. The appearance of the component will change to utilise associated dark mode component tokens.

<DoubleDoDontCaution>
  <DoDontCaution
    imageSrc={[Fig4Appearance, Fig4AppearanceDark]}
    imageAlt="Figma Appearance properties showing Component Tokens are set to Dark Mode."
    state="none"
  />
</DoubleDoDontCaution>
