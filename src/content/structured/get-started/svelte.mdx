import { IcAlert } from "@ukic/react";

<IcAlert
  variant="info"
  heading="Version check"
  message="These instructions were used with Svelte version 3.50.1."
/>

## Step one

In the root of your project:

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/web-components @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/web-components @ukic/fonts
```

## Step two

Import defineCustomElements in your `main.ts` file.

```jsx
import { defineCustomElements } from "@ukic/web-components/loader";
```

## Step three

Call defineCustomElements in your `main.ts` file:

```jsx
//other configuration
...
defineCustomElements();
```

## Step four

Add the following into the top level CSS file for your project. For newly generated Svelte projects this will be `src/global.css`.

```css
@import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
@import "@ukic/web-components/dist/core/core.css";
```

<br />

<p>
  In order to be rendered consistently across browsers and in line with modern
  standards, each of the components uses styles from a global CSS file based on{" "}
  <ic-link
    target="_blank"
    href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/"
    rel="noreferer noopener nofollow"
  >
    Normalize.css
  </ic-link>
  .
</p>

If you would like to import these styles to apply them to the rest of your project and slotted elements used within any of the components, add the following into the top level CSS file as well.

```css
@import "@ukic/web-components/dist/core/normalize.css";
```

## Step five

In your HTML, you can now declare a component as follows:

```html
<ic-status-tag label="Neutral"></ic-status-tag>
```
