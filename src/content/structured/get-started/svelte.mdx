These instructions were used with Svelte version 3.50.1.

## Step one

In the root of your project:

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/web-components @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/web-components @ukic/fonts
```

## Step two

Import defineCustomElements in your `main.ts` file.

```jsx
import { defineCustomElements } from "@ukic/web-components/loader";
```

## Step three

Call defineCustomElements in your `main.ts` file:

```jsx
//other configuration
...
defineCustomElements();
```

## Step four

In your HTML, you can now declare a component as follows:

```html
<ic-status-tag label="Neutral"></ic-status-tag>
```

## Step five

To get the correct styling with the ICDS components, import the core CSS file.

Add the following into the top level CSS file for your project. For newly generated Svelte projects this will be `src/global.css`.

```css
@import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
@import "@ukic/web-components/dist/core/core.css";
```

<br />

In order to be rendered consistently across browsers and in line with modern standards, each of the ICDS components uses styles from a global CSS file based on [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

If you would like to import these styles to apply them to the rest of your project and slotted elements used within any of the ICDS components, add the following into the top level CSS file as well.

```css
@import "@ukic/web-components/dist/core/normalize.css";
```
