## Introduction

Design principles should be referred to throughout the whole design process to question whether design decisions uphold the principles or break them.

## Inclusivity by design

The Design System's contents, components, patterns and processes should be able to be used by everyone equally. This means addressing accessibility and context of use as well as personal preference.

## Consistency through re-use

We use re-usable patterns and components to drive consistency through the use of familiar and intuitive design.

## Mission driven

We build by listening to the Intelligence Community in order to deliver their specific needs.

## Research first

We make decisions based on data and research, not opinions.

## Flexible, adaptive, powerful

The system should be flexible; it should adapt as necessary; it should empower users.

## Continuously evolving

The system should evolve to stay in alignment with modern practices and adapt to include new content that helps to solve new design problems. Future proofing enables adoption and sustainability.

## Transparent and open

Enable feedback on processes and content from the entire community. Allow contribution from users as well as producers.

## Responsible

We factor environmental sustainability into our decisions, minimising our resource usage and enabling the community to do the same.
