## Step one

In the root of your project, run:

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/react @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/react @ukic/fonts
```

## Step Two

Install the `gatsby-plugin-stencil` package to allow Gatsby to render the components server-side.

```shell
// using npm
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-stencil
```

## Step three

In your `gatsby-config.js` file (at the root of the project), add the following:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-stencil`,

    options: {
      module: "@ukic/web-components",
      renderToStringOptions: {
        prettyHtml: true,
      },
    },
  },
];
```

## Step four

Import the component(s) in your Gatsby pages.

```jsx
import { IcComponent } from "@ukic/react";
```

## Step five

To get the correct styling for the ICDS components, import the core CSS file.

Add the following to the top level index file of your project.

```jsx
import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
import "@ukic/react/dist/core/core.css";
```

<br />

In order to be rendered consistently across browsers and in line with modern standards, each of the ICDS components uses styles from a global CSS file based on [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

If you would like to import these styles to apply them to the rest of your project and slotted elements used within any of the ICDS components, add the following into the top level index file as well.

```jsx
import "@ukic/react/dist/core/normalize.css";
```
