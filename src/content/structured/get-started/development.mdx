## Installing the components

The development library provides a robust set of UI components that are not only high-quality and visually appealing but also thoroughly tested for reliability and performance.

With a focus on accessibility and ease of use, these components empower developers to create responsive and inclusive experiences.

    message="Install and use the UI Kit component library. Use React or web components to quickly build accessible interfaces."

    imageSrc={[InstallComponents, InstallComponentsDark]}
    imageAlt="A download icon"
  />
  <GetStartedVerticalCard
