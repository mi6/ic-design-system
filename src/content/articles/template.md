# Template

**This file should always be kept, alongside any submodules that contain the actual content you wish to display.**

The frontmatter in this file contains all optional fields used throughout this application. This prevents any errors arising due to a GraphQL query being unable to find any records containing the field it cares about.

## A hidden file

The file shouldn't appear in any search results, due to the _hidden_ field in the frontmatter, but should be available to view at /template.
